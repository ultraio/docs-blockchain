# Tutorial - Setup the Ultra Wallet

Ultra Wallet browser extension is a crypto wallet that helps you access decentralized applications on Ultra blockchain and securely manage digital assets. This tutorial will cover the simplest process of setting up the Ultra Wallet and adding your keys to the wallet.

## Prerequisites

-   Have a [private and public key pair](../../blockchain/general/antelope-ultra/public-and-private-keys.md). To generate a key pair, please follow the [Generate a key and create a developer Testnet account](./tutorial-generate-key-and-create-testnet-account.md) tutorial.
-   Have a chromium based browser since Ultra Wallet only supports chromium based browsers.

## Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to add your developer account to the Ultra Wallet. The Ultra Wallet will be used in later tutorials to demonstrate interaction with the blockchain.

## Setup

1. Download or use Chrome, Brave, or Chromium Equivalent
2. Install the [Ultra Wallet Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ultra-wallet/kjjebdkfeagdoogagbhepmbimaphnfln). Simply click `Add to` on the extension page

## Open Ultra Wallet

Open your `Ultra Wallet` by clicking it inside of the extensions panel.
