# Requesting a client_id

Ultra's authentication servers, both for their staging and their production environments, are protected by Keycloak.

To access them, you'll require a `client_id`. This can be requested directly from [developers@ultra.io](mailto:developers@ultra.io).

Without this you will not be able to use the Unity plugin, integrate into Epic's Online Service for multiplayer, or integrate your app directly into Ultra's client.
