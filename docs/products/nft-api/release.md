# Release notes

We're thrilled to announce the release of a new version of the Ultra API. This update focuses on enhancing user experience, increasing performance, and introducing new functionalities to make integration even more seamless.

## Key Highlights

-   Introducing the `uniqSnapshots` subscription! Refer to the `uniqSnapshots` subscription section for more information. We highly recommend using this new subscription. Please note that the `uniqsOfFactory` and `uniqsOfWallet` subscriptions are now deprecated.
-   Introducing the `uniqFactorySnapshots` subscription! Refer to the `uniqFactorySnapshots` subscription section for more information. We highly recommend using this new subscription. Please note that the `uniqFactories` subscription is now deprecated.
-   Explore the new `uniqGlobalShares` query! Find details in the `uniqGlobalShares` query section. We strongly recommend using this query to compute sale shares prices. The `uniqGlobalShares` query provides the protocol fee basis point applied to each resale. Reminder: Owner revenue = Price - (Price x 0.0001 x (Protocol fee basis point + Promoter fee basis point + Creators shares basis point)).

## Breaking changes

-   **Removed** enum `BlockStep` - The Ultra API will now reflect only irreversible transactions.

-   **Removed** type `UniqRevenue`

-   **Renamed** type `UniqFactoryResaleShare` to `UniqSaleShare`

-   **Structure changes** of the `UniqResale`.
    ```
    type UniqResale {
        onSaleDate: Date!
        price: UniqRevenue!
    }
    ```
    Becomes :
    ```
    type UniqResale {
        onSaleDate: Date!
        price: MonetaryAmount!
        promoterBasisPoints: Int
        shares: [UniqSaleShare!]!
    }
    ```

## Bugfixes

-   Resolved issues related to metadata not being present for old uniqs or factory. The API now correctly includes metadata for all uniqs and factory instances.
-   Fixed issues with trading/transfer windows. Users can now perform trading and transfers without encountering unexpected errors or disruptions.
