# Declaring a Game

Game developers have often more than 1 game under their belt and for that reason, we organised Ultra’s GDC in such a way that each game has its own “publishing environment” where you conveniently can set everything related to that particular game such as:

-   The game store page
-   Manage the game files
-   Set the game token factories
-   Manage the game’s SDK functionalities

Declaring a new game is as easy as pressing the Create new game button and giving it a name. Note: Don’t worry, your game won’t be visible to the public unless you publish your game store page.
