# Uniq variants - On issue.b smart contract example

This page describes an example smart contract that utilizes smart contract notifications produced by `eosio.nft.ft` contract when one of the actions within it are utilized. As a goal for this smart contract we chose to modify the token URI right after it is minted based on it's serial number. For tokens with even or odd serial number we will substitute one of 2 possible URIs.

### Logic

When writing a smart contract that actively interacts with some other contract you need to either write some definitions to properly read the data from that other smart contract or you will need to get the definitions directly from the smart contract source code. This is needed since data on blockchain is stored in dense binary representation so without these definitions you will only be able to get the raw binary data from the smart contract which is not convenient to work with.

For this smart contract to properly interact with `eosio.nft.ft` we will need information regarding the following tables:

- `token.b` - described using `token_v1` structure. This table stores information about all tokens of NFT standard v1
- `next.token` - described using `next_token_number` structure. This singleton stores the id of the next token that will be minted, by subtracting 1 you get the id of the token that was previously minted.

To know the layout of those tables refer to the following documents <INSERT_LINK_HERE>

In addition to the above we also need to define an action within our smart contract with interface that matches `issue.b` action. This will cause `eosio.nft.ft` contract to notify us when `issue.b` action is executed and the account that will host this contract (here it will be `onissue`) is involved in the minting process (e.g. `onissue` is the issuer of the token). For that the following interface is re-created with an indication to listen for `issue.b` action:

```cpp
[[eosio::on_notify("eosio.nft.ft::issue.b")]]
void on_issue(const issue_wrap_v1& issue);
```

We will also add 2 extra actions to be able to configure which URI will be used depending on if serial number is odd or even. This data will be stored a simple singleton `uricfg` and depending on the scope it will be either for even URIs (scope is 0) or for odd URIs (scope is 1). The actions themselves are `even_uri` and `odd_uri` and they simply write input string into the singleton.

Logic for `on_issue` listener is to first deduce the token ID that was just minted by reading `next.token` singleton, then to read the `token.b` to get the serial number of the token. After that we simply read `uricfg` singleton and get the URI to write based on the serial number of the token and do an inline call to `settknmeta`. The `settknmeta` action will be responsible for writing the new URI we want into the token data since our example contract does not have authority to change data of other smart contracts - we can only read the data and do inline action calls.

::: info
To be able to do the inline call to `settknmeta` an extra permission is required for `onissue` account. It is configured in the test using the following `cleos` command:
```
await cleos(`set account permission onissue active --add-code onissue -p onissue@owner`)
```
This is equivalent to adding `onissue@eosio.code` account permission inside `onissue@active`. And effectively means that smart contract stored in `onissue` account has same authority that `onissue@active` would have
:::

### Disclaimers

::: warning
This example contract is not production ready and has some functionality and checks missing, be sure to do a proper testing if you intend to use any of the code provided in your solution
:::

::: warning
This contract only listens to `issue.b` action, but tokens may also be issued when `issue` action is called after v1 actions are enabled. That means that in addition to listening to `issue.b` action you may also want to listen to `issue` action. This is only applicable in cases where you don't control the service that initiates the minting process (e.g. token is issued from 3rd party to your service). This example contract assumes you have full control over the minting process so only `issue.b` action is considered
:::

::: warning
`issue.b` action supports minting multiple tokens at a time but this example contract will only update the very last token minted per `issue.b` action. This again assumes you have full ownership of the minting process and can control the number of tokens minted at a time. If this is not the case the smart contract will require adjustments to support multiple tokens minted at a time.
:::

::: warning
This contract assumes no one will be issuing tokens to `onissue` contract so if someone actually does try to issue a token this example contract will try to modify it, but will fail since it will most likely not be the factory manager.
:::

### How to build and test

First step after writing the `onissue.hpp` and `onissue.cpp` will be to build the contract. Follow <INSERT_LINK_HERE> for instructions for simplest build process.

As an alternative the build command using `eosio-cpp`:

```bash
eosio-cpp ./src/onissue.cpp -abigen
```

After you successfully compile the contract you will have two files: `onissue.abi` and `onissue.wasm` both of them are needed for proper functionality of your contract on-chain.

The test provided in `onissue.ultra_test.js` in the section below assumes that the compiled contract is located at `pconfig.ultraRootPath + '/eosio.contracts/build/contracts/onissue'` where `ultraRootPath` is the persistent path configured for `ultratest` (e.g. the end result could be `~/ultra/eosio.contracts/build/contracts/onissue`). In your case it may not be true so be sure to modify the `set contract` section of the test with correct path to your contract.

To run the test simply run the `ultratest` with proper path to the test file:

```bash
ultratest -t ./onissue.ultra_test.js
```
