# Introducing Uniq Avatars

The Ultra Avatar contract, `ultra.avatar` allows users to set an Uniq as their avatar.

The user sets an avatar using the `setavatar` action and it is then availabe for anyone using Ultra's blockchain to view and use. They read data from the contract and render the Uniq inside their app.

Users can change their avatar with the same action or remove avatar completely with the `clearavatar` action.

If a user loses possession of the Uniq through transfer or burn actions, it can no longer be used as an avatar.
