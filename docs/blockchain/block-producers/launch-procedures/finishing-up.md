# Finishing Up

After activating the chain state, it is important to speak with the other Block Producers and ensure they are producing blocks on their end. Screenshots and other forms of data sharing should be used to validate that the network is running as intended.

Follow-ups via the provided private Slack channel are also very important to ensure everything is running smoothly and communication lines are open both between the Block Producers and Ultra.

Once everything is running smoothly, Block Producers may expose their api endpoints as necessary.
