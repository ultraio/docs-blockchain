# Set a Branch and Publish

Click on Add, to see the available branches

Note:

-   You can have multiple branches on the same assemble version
-   You can’t have the same branch on multiple assemble build versions
-   When you publish a branch, you must select one of your assemble versions

If the branch was never published you can remove it by passing it over the button and clicking on the plus icon.

After making changes save it by clicking on “Save Changes”.

Now you can publish your build by clicking on publish.
