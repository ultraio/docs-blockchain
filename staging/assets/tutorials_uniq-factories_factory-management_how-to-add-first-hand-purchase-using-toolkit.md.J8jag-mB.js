You must be a manager of that factory</li><li><strong>Purchase option index</strong> - A number that will let you identify the purchase option, in case there are multiple options per factory. It can be any positive number you want, we advise you to start from 0 and increase it by one for any new purchase option you add. Note that if you set the purchase requirement with an existing index then it will overwrite it.</li><li><strong>Purchase price</strong> - Required payment in UOS or USD (will be converted to UOS at the time of purchase) to be able to purchase a Uniq. It can also be set to 0 but only if the <code>Purchase option with Uniqs</code> is set.</li><li><strong>Purchase limit</strong> - Dictates the maximum number of Uniqs that can be bought using this option specifically. The limit is not shared between the options. If you need to have a total cap then you better manage it though the minting limit of the factory. Optional, can leave it empty.</li><li><strong>Promoter basis point</strong> - A share of UOS that a promoter will get at the time of purchase, specified in basis points. Must be at least 200 (which is equal to 2%).</li><li><strong>Purchase option with Uniqs</strong> - Allows you to specify the price for this purchase option using Uniqs from other factories or to require the buyer to own Uniqs from specific factories. This field is covered in more detail in the later example in this guide.</li><li><strong>Sale shares</strong> - Specifies the list of accounts who will get a share of UOS from the purchase done using this purchase option. The <code>Basis points</code> field determines how much the account will get, specified in basis points (1 point = 0.01%). Optional, can leave it empty.</li><li><strong>Maximum UOS payment</strong> - The maximum amount of UOS you are ok to pay to create the purchase option. The payment is only used to cover RAM costs and is predictable. Optional, can leave it empty.</li><li><strong>Group restriction</strong> - Allows you to specify user groups who are able or not able to use this purchase option. Refer to <a href="./../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/setprchsreq.b.html">action documentation</a> for a deeper explanation on how to use the user group restriction.

Optional, can leave it empty.</li><li><strong>Purchase window end</strong> - Makes it so the purchase option is only available until some point in time in the format of <code>2021-05-01T00:00:00</code>.

It must be at least equal to the current price of the purchase option converted to UOS (in case it is originally specified in USD). You can put a larger value here but you will not be charged more than the current price at the time the transaction is executed.

It can be the same as the <code>Buyer</code> in most cases.</li><li><strong>Promoter</strong> - The account that will get a share of UOS from this purchase. If you are building a marketplace you would want to specify your account as a promoter to receive a share of UOS from each purchase. If not specified then Ultra will be used as a promoter.</li><li><strong>Provided Uniqs</strong> - The list of Uniqs that you want to check, burn, or transfer. This is required if the purchase option specifies <code>Purchase option with Uniqs</code>.

This option allows you to require a payment to be done using Uniqs from other factories or to simply require a user to own a Uniq from a specific factory.</p><p>First, navigate to <a href="https://toolkit.ultra.io/factoryManagement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Factory management actions</a>, search again for <code>setprchsreq</code>, and select the <code>Set first-hand purchase requirement (eosio.nft.ft::setprchsreq.b)</code> action.</p><p>To specify the price in Uniqs you use the <code>Purchase option with Uniqs</code> field. You can add multiple entries to this field, each field corresponds to a single factory. Here is a breakdown for each of the fields:</p><ul><li><strong>Transfer tokens receiver account</strong> - The account that will receive the Uniqs from the factories that use the strategy of 2 (transfer). This field is mandatory to specify if any of the factories use the strategy of 2 (transfer).</li><li><strong>Required factories</strong> - The list of factories required for this purchase option. Each one of them has the following fields: <ul><li><strong>Token factory ID</strong> - The ID of the factory that is required for this purchase option.</li><li><strong>Count</strong> - How many Uniqs are required from the specified factory. Note that there is no way to specify any properties of the required Uniq, as long as it is from required factory it will work.</li><li><strong>Strategy</strong> - There are 3 ways you can require Uniqs within your purchase option: <ul><li>Check if account owns a Uniq from a specific factory (strategy 0)</li><li>Burn required Uniqs (strategy 1)</li><li>Transfer a Uniq from the owner to the account specified in <code>Transfer tokens receiver account</code> (strategy 2)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>For more details see the <a href="./../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/setprchsreq.b.html">action documentation</a>.</p><p>In the following example we will configure a purchase option to burn a single Uniq in order to mint another one. This effectively swaps user&#39;s Uniq from one to another. The price will be set to 0 UOS so the only requirement is to have a Uniq from the specified factory.</p><p>This effectively achieves a swap mechanism where you &quot;swap&quot; one Uniq which you have for another one from the same or different factory and, potentially, a different metadata.</p><p>If you want to try and do the same you need to have a second factory or use the same one you already have. Note that if you reuse the same factory which does not have variants then it is effectively a useless operation as you will get a Uniq identical to the one you have burned.</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt=""></p><p>After filling out the form, click on <code>Send 1 Action</code>, review the details, and confirm the transaction.</p><p>You can now navigate to <a href="https://toolkit.ultra.io/uniqFactory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Factory explorer</a>, enter your Factory ID, and scroll down to see the new purchase option created.</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt=""></p><h2 id="how-to-buy-a-uniq-using-a-first-hand-purchase-option-with-price-in-uniqs" tabindex="-1">How to buy a Uniq using a first-hand purchase option with price in Uniqs <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-buy-a-uniq-using-a-first-hand-purchase-option-with-price-in-uniqs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How to buy a Uniq using a first-hand purchase option with price in Uniqs&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The process of purchasing Uniq using the purchase option with Uniqs requirement is similar, but requires you to fill the <code>Provided Uniqs field</code>.</p><p>To do so, first navigate to <a href="https://toolkit.ultra.io/factoryManagement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Factory management actions</a>, and search again for <code>purchase</code> and select <code>Purchase Uniqs directly (eosio.nft.ft::purchase.a)</code>.</p><p>If the purchase option requires Uniqs from other factories then the account must have those Uniqs in its inventory.
