# How to read the Block Explorer

A block explorer is a web tool that allows users to view information about cryptocurrency transactions and blockchain data. It provides details such as transaction history, wallet balances, and block information, enhancing transparency and accountability.

## Our Explorers

* [Main Network](https://explorer.mainnet.ultra.io/)
* [Test Network (You probably want this one)](https://explorer.testnet.ultra.io/)

## Usage

In most cases the search bar at the top takes any of the following:

* Account Name
* Transaction ID
* Block Number

### Example Queries

::: details Examples

```
account:eosio.token 

receiver:eosio.token (data.from:eoscanadacom OR data.to:eoscanadacom)

## Account Page


### Account Balance

Account balance is available at the top.

### RAM & Power

Both of these are available on the account page as well.

`âˆž` means the account has no limitations. Otherwise, most accounts have a limitation.

Storing data on-chain costs `RAM`.

Executing transactions utilizes `POWER`.

### Permissions

You can see who owns an account, or what key has control over an account under the `permissions` section.

The +1/1 shows how many signatures are necessary to act on behalf of a `permission`. Permission being `active` or `owner` in the example below.

In the example below the `tech` `permission` requires two users to a transaction to act on behalf of the `ultra@tech` account.

### Contracts

When you are on an account page such as `eosio.token` you can see that it has a contract deployed because it has the `tables` and `ABI` tabs.

### Tables

Tables can be browsed for additional information if you're aware of how the table is structured. In the case of `eosio.nft.ft` I can view the `factory.b` table to see available Uniqs. Tables available can be gathered from the `abi` tab.

It's highly recommended to use `curl` requests against [REST API Endpoints](./how-to-make-a-rest-request.md) when reading data, or write a small script in one of your favorite programming languages.
