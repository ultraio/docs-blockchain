# Overview

Every time you run FileBeam and upload files, the repositories receiving files will have their repository version number incremented. Many game developers release a game and later add additional DLCs, this will make the new DLC version number diverge from other repositories versions.

For example, Core Game Files v4 and DLC MissionPack1 V1 in the image below have different version numbers even though the files contained in them actually are meant to work together.

In some cases, you will find translation errors in your game which you might want to fix in one particular language pack. Updating your language pack will cause its repository version to have a different version number than your other repositories.

For these kinds of reasons, in Ultra, a game build is a collection of various repositories who often have different version numbers and that’s perfectly fine.

> Different game build versions are actually made out of different repositories versions

Once you have a “game build version” you can assign it a Branch. For example, MyGame Standard Edition promotes Game Build V2 as its Beta branch. **Coming Soon, only the Master branch can be used at the moment**

> On the left, the build V1 is promoted as master branch of My Game Standard Edition, on the right the build V2 is promoted to the master branch

As soon as you promote build V2 as the master branch, all gamers who had V1 installed will be promped to update their next time they try to launch it. Also, from here on, anyone who installs the game will directly get V2 files.

### Important to know

Including a DLC repository in a build doesn’t mean the buyer of the game will receive this DLC! It only means the files contained in the DLC repository version you associated with this build are compatible with this build. In other words, the buyer will still have to separately buy the DLC to get it, and when he buys it, Ultra’s file distribution system will know what DLC repository version to download for this particular game build version.

In the future you’ll be able to “bundle” DLCs tokens with Game tokens, allowing you to sell your game containing DLCs. In the meantime, if you want gamers to get DLCs as part of the game they buy, upload DLC files in your core game files repository.

When you include a Language pack version in a build, the buyer of this build will have the ability to download it if he wants it. If you want to separately sell a language pack you need to upload the language pack in a DLC repository and sell it as a DLC.

## Assembling a Game Build

Once you have created a file repository, the ‘Assemble Game Builds’ menu will become available.

Before we can assemble a game build version, we first need to create a game build.

1.  Click on Create new game build
2.  Select the OS you want your game build on (currently only Windows is available)
3.  Set the Internal Game build name.
4.  Select a repository and a version of it.

7.  Specify the executable file to run the game, whether it’s for 32 bits, 64 bits, or both.

10.  If there are additional sets of files, such as DLCs, you can select which of them should be compatible with the build you're assemnbling.
11.  Create the game build.

Now you should be done with assembling the game build, you can determine whether this build version is a **Master** one (intended for public release) or **Beta** (as mentioned before, this is still not available).

Congratulations your build is now created!
