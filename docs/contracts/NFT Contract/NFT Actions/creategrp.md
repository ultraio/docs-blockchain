# creategrp

Creates a factory group.

## Technical Behavior

* Anyone can create a factory group. RAM is charged in the beginning so a creator needs to make sure max_uos_payment is larger than charged value.

* `factories` field cannot contain duplicates.

**RAM usage/cost calculation and payment/refund**

-   RAM usage used to store factory group info is covered by `eosio.nftram` account. If the unused RAM of eosio.nftram is less than or equal to 200MB, the action canâ€™t be executed.

-   The cost of a factory group entry is paid to `eosio.nftram` and it will be locked up in this entry. The funds are released back to the original payer after the factory group is deleted

      -   First, the cost in USD is (factory RAM payment size) \* (RAM price), where

          -   NFT RAM payment size: **960 bytes**. Estimated for:
              - `uri` with length of 256
              - 64 entries in `factories`

          -   RAM price: **0.15 USD/KB**

      -   The cost is paid in UOS. The action gets `1 MINUTE` conversion rate in USD/UOS from `eosio.oracle` contract. and calculates the cost by
          (960B/1024B \* 0.15USD/KB) / (conversion rate) = `0.140625` **USD**/(conversion rate)

-   When a factory group manager adds or removes a factory from the group

    -   No additional RAM is charged for or released funds for
