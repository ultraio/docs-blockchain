# Overview

FileBeam is a Python application that lets you upload your games files in appropriate repositories.

New repositories are only created when one or more new files you uploaded in them have changed. In other words if your language pack or if your DLC files haven’t changed, no new repository versions will be created.

## Uploading files with FileBeam

![fb-1](/images/gdc/fb-1.png)

-   Copy it, by clicking on the copy icon you will need it later on.
-   Then open this file in a text editor: C:\\Users\\duclo\\AppData\\Local\\UltraOS\\Application\\2.10.3.144\\sdk-direct6\\DIRECT6\\ultra_auth.json
-   Then set your GDC account password and then save the file.

-   Next, paste the file repository ID to name the repository in the script. We use here “WINDLCa8df6455-1c24-4b71-82c6-9d0c4ceb98bd” but it needs to correspond to the real ID of your file repository, otherwise, the end-users will be unable to download the content.
-   Then set the local repository path where the game files are stored. It is named the source in the script. Here we use C:\\Users\\”username”\\Desktop\\”Game file”\\
-   Then navigate to: UltraOS\\Application\\x.xx.x.xxx\\sdk-direct6\\DIRECT6\\deploy\\, example:

```sh
cd UltraOS\Application\x.xx.x.xxx\sdk-direct6\DIRECT6\deploy\
```

Then with all those parameters set, run the script (NOTE: Source Directory doesn’t support space in the path)

```sh
\python.exe ./release_upload.py --email="yourGDCAccount@ultra.io" --sourceDirectory=C:\\Users\\Arnaud\\Desktop\\WarcraftIII\\ --repositoryName="WINCOREG58dc2209-0cfa-492a-8777-a35fc99802f4"
```

Then add your password in the console:

Once the upload is finished, a message will be displayed in the console.

![fb-5](/images/gdc/fb-5.png)

Then refresh the page in the GDC, a new version of the repository should be available. You can do this by verifying that the IDs are identical.

![fb-6](/images/gdc/fb-6.png)

Congratulations, your first file has been uploaded on Ultra
