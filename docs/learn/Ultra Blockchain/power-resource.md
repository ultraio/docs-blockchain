# POWER Resource

## What is POWER?

POWER is required for sending transactions to the network, it represents the share of total resources that an account has to transact. You can transact without any POWER, but if enough people with more POWER are transacting, your transactions might be delayed or rejected.

## What is it used for?

To make sure that vendors and other important businesses on the network have the ability to run operations without being interrupted. For example if a game company has a big release coming out, they want to prioritize their transactions going through over the rest of the network for the duration of their event. Without POWER it may be possible encounter rate limiting which will prevent any additional transactions to be pushed
