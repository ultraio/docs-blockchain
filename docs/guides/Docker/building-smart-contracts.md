# Building Smart Contracts

A smart contract is written in C++ but compiled into WASM.

Developers must have some knowledge in C++ to write smart contracts for the Ultra Blockchain.

## Hello World Smart Contract

Recommended to setup a [VSCode Environment](./development-environment.md) before moving forward.

### Setup

Create a directory called `hello` inside of any of the following directories:

-   Windows: `C:\\Users\\Username\\ultra_workdir\\hello`

-   Linux: `~/ultra_workdir/hello`

-   Docker Container: `/opt/ultra_workdir/hello`

_Additional permissions may be required to create the directory._

### Create hello.cpp

Navigate to the following directory.

```
cd /opt/ultra_workdir/hello
```

Create the file `hello.cpp` inside of the `hello` directory.

Then place the following content inside of `hello.cpp` and ensure you save the file.

```cpp
#include <eosio/eosio.hpp>
class [[eosio::contract]] hello : public eosio::contract {
  public:
      using eosio::contract::contract;
      [[eosio::action]]
      void hi( eosio::name user ) {
         print( "Hello, ", user);
      }
};
```

_Above is Content for `hello.cpp`_

## eosio-cpp binary

There is a single binary which is included with our docker image.

### What is it?

- A clang-based WASM compiler and ABI generator tool
- Must be ran anywhere inside of the docker image

### Usage

```
eosio-cpp -help
```

## Compiling a Smart Contract

Using the above `hello.cpp` file we can utilize `eosio-cpp` to compile it.

Run the following command **inside the docker image**.

```cpp
eosio-cpp hello.cpp
```

Three files should be created in the `hello` directory.

- hello.cpp
  - This is the source code of an example smart contract.
- hello.abi
  - This file describes the interface of the smart contract.
- hello.wasm
  - This is a compiled Web Assembly smart contract.

After compiling the smart contract there are two options for deployment in the local development environment.

- [Deploy with 'ultratest' framework](./ultratest.md)
- ['cleos' based contract deployment](./cleos.md#deploying-a-smart-contract)

## CMake

When building smart contracts, developers may have more than one file. While `eosio-cpp` provides the basics, it is recommended to use CMake for anything more complex than single file.

We will try compiling the `eosio.token` contract in this example.

### Preparations

Create a directory called `eosio.token` in one of the following locations:

-   Windows: `C:\\Users\\Username\\ultra_workdir\\eosio.token`

-   Linux: `~/ultra_workdir/eosio.token`

-   Docker Container: `/opt/ultra_workdir/eosio.token`

After creating the directory, create directories inside of `eosio.token` with the following paths:

- `eosio.token/include/eosio.token`
- `eosio.token/src`

Obtain the following files from [the following markdown page](../../examples/eosio.token.md) and append the content from each section in their own corresponding file.

### Example Folder Structure

```
/opt/ultra_workdir/eosio.token/
    |
    |- CMakeLists.txt
    |- include/
    |  |- eosio.token/
    |     |- eosio.token.hpp
    |- src/
        |- eosio.token.cpp
```

### Building with the Wrapper Script

Inside of the docker image there is a script called `build_contracts` which can be ran from anywhere inside of the docker image.

This script will create a build folder and put build artifacts (wasm and abi files) in the folder.

Run the following command in any folder.

```
build_contracts
```

If everything is setup correctly the script will automatically tap into the `CMakeLists.txt` and build your contract.

## Additional Files with CMake

CMake has a handful of functions that can be placed inside of a `CMakeLists.txt` file to include other files, and folders.

---

`target_include_directories(target PUBLIC dir_list)`

> Specifies include directories to use when compiling a given target.

**Example**

This example shows how to include other folders.

```
target_include_directories(mycontract 
    PUBLIC 
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include 
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/common/include 
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/mycontract_specific/include)
```

---

`add_contract`

>Used to build your smart contract and generate an ABI, the first parameter is the contract name, the second is the cmake target name, and the rest are the CPP files needed to build the contract.

**Example**

This example shows how to include additional `.cpp` source files.

```
add_contract(mycontract mycontract 
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/a.cpp 
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/b.cpp)
```
