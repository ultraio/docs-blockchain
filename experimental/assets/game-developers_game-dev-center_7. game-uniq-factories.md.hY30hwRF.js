You will be able to set all your commercial requirements and uniq rules into the Store Token Factory, like setting a game for internal usage or to organize a restricted close beta (both planned). Every uniq factory and uniq will be represented in our platform through a uniq ID card, which will contain all uniq functionalities and is contextualized all over the platform.</p><p>Additionally, this is where you will set all the rules for your game lifecycle. Once done, everyone who buys from this factory will receive a token bound by these rules. Currently, our uniq factories are only able to create an atomic token.</p><h3 id="uniqs-tokens" tabindex="-1">Uniqs / Tokens <a class="header-anchor" href="#uniqs-tokens" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Uniqs / Tokens&quot;">​</a></h3><p>A uniq is an immutable unit of your content, it follows the rules set of the emitting uniq factory. This uniq will give access to the content that its linked repository contains. Uniq factories have a real numeric version of your retail game, which provides you more features and more control on your side. Additionally, there are different types of uniq factories such as Game, Demo, DLC, etc…</p><p>The following is the lifecycle statuses of a uniq factory:</p><ul><li>Draft</li><li>Ready to publish</li><li>Published</li><li>Expired (not available yet)</li><li>Unpublished (not available yet)</li><li>Disabled</li></ul><p><strong>Atomic token</strong>: A type of uniq that will give specific content access defined by the selected branch to a player. This is only the first type of token but we are planning to add more in the future to give you more flexibility and open new business opportunities.</p><p><strong>Game package</strong>: A single uniq that gives a user access to a game&#39;s contents (Example: Game with DLC on a single token). Bundles and packs that can be sold together as uniqs this way.</p><h2 id="uniq-factories" tabindex="-1">Uniq Factories <a class="header-anchor" href="#uniq-factories" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Uniq Factories&quot;">​</a></h2><p>You are currently able to create games, demos, and DLC uniqs that have their own preset rules.</p><ul><li>Games: You can freely configure your game without restriction.</li><li>DLC: You can freely configure your game without restriction.</li><li>DEMO: Not available yet.</li><li>Language pack: Not available yet.</li><li>Dedicated server: Not available yet.</li></ul><p>Reminder: To create a uniq factory you should have published an assembly build first, then linked it to the token factory.</p><h3 id="creating-a-store-token-factory" tabindex="-1">Creating a &quot;Store token factory&quot; <a class="header-anchor" href="#creating-a-store-token-factory" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Creating a &quot;Store token factory&quot;&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Click on “Create a new token factory”</p><p><img src="https://github.com/Tomas-Cucit/docs-blockchain/assets/140004349/3a2a5480-ad1b-4bbe-bbc1-e059ca792a7f" alt="image"></p><ul><li>This name will be visible to end users</li><li>You can start your factory from scratch or you can create a factory from an existing one to copy its settings, which you can then edit.</li></ul><p><img src="https://github.com/Tomas-Cucit/docs-blockchain/assets/140004349/136a6a6f-e7cb-4450-a04a-e8509169e45a" alt="image"></p><ul><li>If you are starting from scratch then you need to choose the type of uniq you want to use.</li><li>Click on &quot;Create&quot; to start the creation of your uniq.</li><li>Congratulations, at this point your uniq factory is now created (although not published), you can come back to finish it later.</li></ul><p><img src="https://github.com/Tomas-Cucit/docs-blockchain/assets/140004349/667e3444-fb9e-43ec-850e-aff0c10f93d3" alt="image"></p><h4 id="configure-the-store-token-factory" tabindex="-1">Configure the Store token factory <a class="header-anchor" href="#configure-the-store-token-factory" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Configure the Store token factory&quot;">​</a></h4><ul><li>If you left your uniq factory in an incomplete state, you can retrieve it from the list and continue setting it up by clicking on &quot;Edit Factory&quot;</li></ul><p><img src="https://github.com/Tomas-Cucit/docs-blockchain/assets/140004349/113ff0f5-028a-448a-bd00-f13c7698043a" alt="image"></p><ul><li>The starting &quot;Main Information&quot; page holds following details: <ul><li>Token name, which should represent the version of your uniq.

We achieve this by tokenizing games, i.e., linking every game or piece of content you want to offer to a uniq that exists on our blockchain and acts as proof of ownership of its corresponding content.</p><p>At the moment, publishing a game with it&#39;s store token factory doesn&#39;t mean that the game is truly tokenized yet. The real uniq factory that will be present in our blockchain needs to be created separately through a process currently managed by Ultra employees. As we continue opening up our ecosystem, we hope to allow third parties to self-manage this.</p><h4 id="tradability-and-resellability" tabindex="-1">Tradability and resellability <a class="header-anchor" href="#tradability-and-resellability" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Tradability and resellability&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Although what you set up on this section within the GDC doesn&#39;t affect the uniq factory&#39;s real settings, it&#39;s still necessary to establish some of its related concepts.</p><ul><li><strong>Tradable</strong> means your token can be sold by end-users that hold it and will appear in the secondhand market.</li><li><strong>Transferable</strong> means that your token can be transferred from one wallet to another, with no cost to it.</li><li><strong>Non tradable</strong> means that your token cannot be set on sale by end-users, and consequently cannot appear in the secondhand market.</li><li><strong>Non transferable</strong> means that your token cannot be sent freely by users .</li></ul><p>Notes:</p><ul><li>A game can be tradable and not transferable, and the other way around.</li><li>You can set a minimum resale price to prevent your game from being sold under a certain price. This can be set both in USD and UOS.</li><li>You can set the revenue share to be earned from the second hand market. The options are to set a fixed price or a % of the selling price set by the customer. Note: To set a fixed amount you need to choose a minimum resale price</li><li>You can set tradability and transferability windows. If set, they will define when your token can be traded/transferred.</li></ul><h3 id="finishing-up" tabindex="-1">Finishing up <a class="header-anchor" href="#finishing-up" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Finishing up&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Even if you didn&#39;t finish the uniq factory yet, the &quot;Preview&quot; option should be available at all times.
