# Getting Access

You need to be a registered developer to get access to Ultra’s Game Developer Center.

1.   Download the [Ultra web installer](https://ultra.io/download)
2.   Register your Ultra account.
3.   Submit your [Ultra Developer application]:
  a.   Gather any relevant docs and info: Email address, Company information, etc..
  b.   Send it all by email to [privacy@ultra.io](mailto:privacy@ultra.io) [developers@ultra.io](mailto:developers@ultra.io)

Once we validate your application you will receive a confirmation email. When this happens, you should close Ultra if it was open and restart it.

A new dimension should now be displayed, which will contain a series of apps including Ultra’s Game Developer Center (GDC)

## Managing your company

When your application is reviewed and approved, a company account will be created for you. Any number of games and members can be under the same company.

On the topic of members, there are three separate roles for them:

-   Company owner: it has total control over both games and other members of the same company. Its permissions can't be changed by other members. At the moment, it can't be changed.
-   Company admin: it has the same level of control as the company owner, but it can be demoted or removed by the owner.
-   Company member: it can create and make changes to game pages, but it can't publish them.

To add someone to your company, follow these steps:

1.   Ask the future member to register an Ultra account
2.   Open the client and access the GDC from an owner or admin account
3.   Navigate to the Company Members section and click on "Add a user"
5.   Enter the user's email address. If you wish to add several people at once, simply click on "Add User Email" as many times as necessary.
7.   Press "Add Users to the Company"
