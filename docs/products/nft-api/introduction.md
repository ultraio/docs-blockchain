# Introduction

Ultra is excited to offer external developers enhanced access to on-chain data through an easily consumable package, designed to streamline the integration process within their applications.

Leveraging the power of [graphQL](https://graphql.org/), the Ultra API adopts a schema-driven approach, making data more accessible and developer-friendly.

Resources provided include:

-   [Authentication](./authentication.md)
-   [Errors](./errors.md)
-   [Queries](./queries.md)
-   [Subscriptions](./subscriptions.md)
-   [Types](./types.md)

## Purpose of the Ultra API

Accessing up-to-date, specific data within our ecosystem can be challenging. This includes information on Uniq Factories, the Uniqs they produce, and associated metadataâ€”all vital components that are traditionally difficult to retrieve.

The Ultra API simplifies the integration and manipulation of NFT data for developers.

## Capabilities Offered by the Ultra API

Focused on NFT data, the Ultra API facilitates a variety of tasks, making the following operations straightforward:

-   Retrieving a complete list of Uniq Factory IDs
-   Fetching details for a specific Uniq Factory using its ID
-   Accessing a particular Uniq with its ID
-   Identifying a Uniq Factory associated with a given Uniq ID
-   Listing Uniqs linked to a wallet ID
-   Extracting Uniq Factory Metadata and/or Media Content by ID, including images, descriptions, and more
-   Determining the type of a Uniq (e.g., collectible, game) via its ID

Additionally, it enables access to marketplace-specific information such as resale status, revenue splits, and metadata conditions.

## Using the Ultra API

Developers need a `client_id` to interact with the Ultra API's endpoints. For access, please send a request to [developers@ultra.io](mailto:developers@ultra.io).
