# Game Developer Center

## Overview

Before we start with a step by step guide on how to upload your game on Ultra, we will start with a high level overview of Ultra’s unique product distribution technology. Unlike other game distribution platforms, on Ultra, product ownership is represented on the blockchain.

Other platforms work like this:
User buys product => Company stores ownership variable on database => Product shows up in user's library

On Ultra, ownership entitlement looks like this:
User buys product => Product's token is added to the user's wallet (which is their blockchain account) => Product shows up in user’s library

In other words, product entitlements are stored on the blockchain instead of a classic database. The advantages of representing product ownership on the blockchain are plentiful.

By setting up a “store token factory” in Ultra’s Game Developer Center (no coding required), you can associate a game build branch to any uniq this uniq factory produces. Do note that at the moment, the uniq factory needs to be created by Ultra employees in order for it to be on our blockchain. More information can be found on the "Uniq Factories" section of this guide.

User purchases a game => Uniq factory produces a uniq => Uniq is sent to user’s wallet => The game appears in the user’s library
