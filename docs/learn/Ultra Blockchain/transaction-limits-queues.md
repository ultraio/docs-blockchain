# Transaction Limits and Queue Mechanism

Ultraâ€™s network provides its users and developers with free transactions.

Ultra has developed a unique queuing mechanism that helps prioritize the large number of transactions that go through the network. This queue also helps deal with potential abusers of the network by eventually de-prioritizing any entity which attempts to flood the network.

Users who have not staked can perform transactions, with their weighting within the prioritized Queue moving down for each transaction. This weight decays with time, ensuring that a user who depleted his position within the queue regains it over time.

Developers who consistently require priority within the queue can stake to the network.

## Toggleable Algorithm

Ultra provides a consistent approach for executing transactions which were added to the queue by prioritizing them based on the POWER. Based on the ranking algorithm specified by `setrankingalgo`.

_Keep in mind that only **Ultra** has the authority to perform these actions._

**Rank based on ratio of available POWER**

```typescript
cleos push action eosio setrankalgo '[0]' -p eosio
```

**Rank based on the delta between POWER quota and POWER usage**

```typescript
cleos push action eosio setrankalgo '[1]' -p eosio
```
