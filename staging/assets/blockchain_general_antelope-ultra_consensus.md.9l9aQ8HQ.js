By making it computationally expensive to find such nonces that make the blocks valid, it becomes difficult for attackers to create an alternative fork of the blockchain that would be accepted by the rest of the network as the best chain. The main disadvantage of Proof of Work is that the security of the network depends on spending a lot of resources on computing power to find the nonces.</p><h3 id="proof-of-stake-pos" tabindex="-1">Proof of Stake (PoS) <a class="header-anchor" href="#proof-of-stake-pos" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Proof of Stake (PoS)&quot;">​</a></h3><p>In Proof-of-Stake, nodes that own the largest stake or percentage of some asset have equivalent decision power. In other words, voting power is proportional to the stake held. One interesting variant is Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) in which a large number of participants or stakeholders elect a smaller number of delegates, which in turn make decisions for them.</p><h3 id="proof-of-authority-poa" tabindex="-1">Proof of Authority (PoA) <a class="header-anchor" href="#proof-of-authority-poa" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Proof of Authority (PoA)&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Proof of Authority is what Ultra is currently based on.</strong></p><p>Proof of Authority (PoA) is a reputation-based consensus algorithm that introduces a practical and efficient solution for blockchain networks (especially the private ones).
