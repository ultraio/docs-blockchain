# Game Developer Center

## Overview

Before we start with a step by step guide on how to upload your game on Ultra, we will start with a high level overview of Ultra’s unique product distribution technology.

Unlike other game distribution platforms, on Ultra, product ownership is represented on the blockchain.

Other platforms works like this:

User buys product => Company stores ownership variable on database => product shows up in user library

On Ultra ownership entitlement looks like this:

User buys product => Gets asset token on his blockchain account => product shows up in user’s library

In other words, product entitlements are stored on the blockchain instead of a classic Database. The advantages of representing product ownership on the blockchain are plentiful.

By setting up a “token factory” in Ultra’s Game Developer Center (no coding required), you can associate a game build branch to any token this token factory produces.

User Purchase game => Token Factory produces token => Token is sent to buyer’s blockchain account => game appear in owner’s inventory
