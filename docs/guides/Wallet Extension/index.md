# Wallet Extension Overview

Ultra Wallet browser extension is a crypto wallet that helps you access decentralized applications on Ultra blockchain and securely manage digital assets.

The principal function is to create and manage private keys on behalf of its users and manage the connections between the wallet and web applications. 

To interact with the wallet, the wallet injects an object named ultra into the javascript context of every site. This object contains all the methods required to obtain the blockchain id, the private key, and sign blockchain transactions.
