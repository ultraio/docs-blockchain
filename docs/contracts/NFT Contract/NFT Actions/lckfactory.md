# lckfactory

Allows a token manager to lock hashes for the factory, default token and all minted tokens as well as any token minted afterwards.

## Technical Behavior

The required authorization is the token_factory_manager as the manager is responsible for updating the data.

**token_factory_id** is required and must exist.

## RAM usage

-   Adding uri and hash will consume certain bytes depend on how many data are added.

    -   RAM usage is covered by eosio.nftram. But this action will fail if the unused RAM of eosio.nftram is less than or equal to 200MB.

    -   If the RAM usage is exceed token maximum pack size of 320 bytes, action will fail.

-   Updating or remove meta data which result in no bytes is added, there will be no restriction.

## Action Parameters

| Property Name    | C++ Type | Javascript Type | Example |
| ---------------- | -------- | --------------- | ------- |
| token_factory_id | uint64_t | number          | 1       |
