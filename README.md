## File Deployment Guide

Each file has a `deploy` property in the front matter tag at the top of the file. 

If you wish to deploy to other environments do the following:

```md
---
title: 'Example Markdown File'
order: 0
deploy: ['staging', 'mainnet']
---

# Example Markdown File

Placeholder
```

## File Order Guide

`order` is an optional property in the front matter at the top.

Specifying the order as a greater number ensures it is higher up in the sidebar.

However, if you want to go lower you can specify a negative number.

The max value ranges between `-9007199254740991` <-> `9007199254740991`.

```md
---
title: 'Example Markdown File'
order: 0
deploy: ['staging', 'mainnet']
---
