Then you can finally set your compatible content on the compatibility matrix. If you do not have compatible content you can skip this step by clicking on create..

Note:

-   You can't have a duplicate of an Assemble build.
-   If you remove compatible content from your previous assembled build compatibility matrix we will gently inform you that you perhaps made a mistake, no worries you still have the option to save in this case to set a new assembled build.
-   Once created an assembled assembly can not be deleted.
