# Block Producers

Block producers play a crucial role Antelope networks. Ultra is an Antelope based network that runs with its own protocol changes and differences. Here's an overview of what Block Producers are expected to do.

### Block Production

Block producers are responsible for creating new blocks in the Antelope blockchain.
They take turns producing blocks in a round-robin fashion, with each producer having a chance to create a block in a designated time slot.

### Transaction Validation

Block producers validate transactions and include them in the blocks they produce.
They ensure that transactions adhere to the consensus rules of the Antelope network and that they are valid.

### Network Maintenance

Block producers contribute to the overall health and security of the Antelope network.
They maintain a node that participates in the consensus algorithm and communicates with other nodes to propagate transactions and blocks across the network.

### Security Measures

Block producers implement security measures to protect the network from potential attacks.
This includes measures such as ensuring the integrity of the blocks, preventing double-spending, and safeguarding against other types of malicious activities.

### Governance Participation

In some blockchain networks, including Antelope-based ones, block producers may also be involved in the governance of the network.
They may participate in voting on protocol upgrades, changes to network parameters, and other important decisions that impact the Antelope ecosystem.

### Performance Optimization

Block producers are expected to maintain reliable and performant infrastructure to ensure the smooth operation of the blockchain.

This includes optimizing server performance, maintaining high-speed internet connections, and promptly addressing any technical issues.

# Infrastructure Overview

## Introduction

This section will guide you through the setup of the infrastructure of your Block Producer. Here you should find the most relevant information on how to set up, configure, and run your Block Producer nodes. Pay close attention to the security tips below and make sure to always exchange information with other Block Producers using the private Slack channel that Ultra provides.

**The infrastructure proposal that we expect Block Producers to follow**

![](/images/secure-infrastructure.png)

## Layer 1: Producing Nodes

These nodes communicate using Wireguard. These nodes should be protected from other Block Producers using API nodes. The Producer Control Switch is a device (normally a PC) that has exclusive access to the Producers. It's function is to access the Producer's plugins like net\_api\_plugin, in order to do operations like stop or pause a producer, switch to the fail-over producer, check the producer status, check the peers status, and other very important actions related to the producer management.

## Layer 2: Relay Nodes

Full nodes to relay blocks, connected to the producing nodes and to other Block Producers via Wireguard. They should also be protected by API nodes.

## Layer 3: API Layer

API layer where Proxy Servers (web firewalls) filter requests using [Patroneos](https://github.com/EOSIO/patroneos). These add an extra layer of protection against malicious or malformed data, as well as against volumetric attacks.

## Layer 4: Load Balancer

Through the Load Balancer incoming API calls are routed to Layer 3 web firewalls.

It is important to note that Antelope software is not good at handling multiple connections. That is why it's important to use API nodes on layers 1 and 2 to communicate with other Block Producers. You should also consider using a load balancer like a [HaProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/) to better handle the connection between your API nodes and other Block Producers.

# Configuration for Block Production

Each Block Producer instance should use this document to configure their networking and to ensure a secure connection between all other Block Producers. We use a service called [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/), a private VPN.

## Setting up Wireguard VPN

Wireguard software will be used to connect the nodes (instances) to each other in a secure, stable, and reliable way. 

**Install Wireguard**

```typescript
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo apt-get update

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wireguard/wireguard
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wireguard
```

**Install resolvconf**

```typescript
sudo apt install resolvconf
```

Create a directory for your producer data and cd into it.

**Generate Keys** 

```typescript
wg genkey | tee wg-private.key | wg pubkey > wg-public.key


Run the following to print the data to the console.
cat wg-public.key
cat wg-private.key
```

**Setup wireguard interface**

```typescript
sudo vim /etc/wireguard/ultra_nodes.conf
OR
sudo nano /etc/wireguard/ultra_nodes.conf
```

Ultra will provide an example of this configuration.

```typescript
[interface]
Address = 192.168.1.1/32
ListenPort = 45888
DNS = 1.1.1.1
PrivateKey = YOUR WIREGUARD PRIVATE KEY

# Producer
[Peer]
PublicKey = YOUR WIREGUARD PUBLIC KEY
AllowedIPs = 192.168.1.1/32
# YOUR PUBLIC IP FOR LINUX
# RUN:
# curl icanhazip.com
Endpoint = ip:45888
PersistentKeepalive = 20

# API-SEED-1
[Peer]
PublicKey = 1vBm7TyQl2KHgU/pG...
AllowedIPs = 192.168.1.2/32
Endpoint = 35.224.180.12:45888
PersistentKeepalive = 20

# API-SEED-2
[Peer]
PublicKey = jOYj5L97khV10o0zHzv2...
AllowedIPs = 192.168.1.3/32
Endpoint = 35.189.216.255:4
```

**Start the VPN**

```typescript
wg-quick up {yourpath/interface_name}
```

If you ever find yourself **needing to stop** wireguard; this can be done by running:

```typescript
wg-quick down {yourpath/interface_name}
```

**Check the connection**

```typescript
sudo wg show
```

Respectively you should see the following or similar if you have a peer added other than yourself.

![](/images/example-peering.png)

Add the path of the nodeos binaries to your PATH environment variable, if you haven’t already.

1.  Create a new folder for the network (eg.: ultranet)
    
2.  Create a folder for the kind of node (Eg.: producer, api...)
    
3.  Create logs folder
    
4.  Create a config.ini provided by Ultra
    
5.  Copy startup.sh and stop.sh scripts provided by Ultra
    
6.  Get the genesis.json file
    

**Note**

*   Always use the startup.sh / stop.sh or nodeos-launcher scripts to manipulate nodeos.
    
*   For every instance (producers, APIs), you must run nodeos for the first time with --genesis-json option.
    

**Only if running an API/Seed instance**

Install nginx

```typescript
sudo apt install nginx
```

Configure server to run at port 80

```typescript
sudo vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
OR
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

**Example Configuration**

```typescript
server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;
        server_name { external_server_ip };

        location /v1/ {
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8888/v1/;
        }

        location / {
                root /home/ubuntu/ultra_testnet/www;
               # return 200 "ultra testnet";
        }
}
```

Enable the nginx service

```typescript
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

Start the service

```typescript
sudo systemctl start nginx
**sudo nginx -s reload -> reload service in case of any config change** 
```

_sudo nginx -s reload -> reload service in case of any config change_

Install certbot for nginx (only for API instance)

Run bot to generate ssl certificates (https - port 443)

```typescript
sudo certbot --nginx -d {server_address_or_domain_including_www_if_necessary}
```

Check if the nginx config file (default -> /etc/nginx/sites-available/default) was edited by the bot

## Configure the Firewall 

**WARNING!**

*   Do not activate the firewall before certifying that the ssh port is open, as you could lose access to the server and you'll have to recreate your instance.
    

```typescript
sudo ufw app list
sudo ufw allow "Nginx Full"
sudo ufw allow 45888/udp
sudo ufw allow 9876/tcp
sudo ufw allow 22
sudo ufw allow in on {server_name_any_name} proto tcp to any port 19876
sudo ufw enable

# Useful commands
sudo ufw status numbered -> status
sudo ufw delete [id] -> delete a rule
```

Configure a load balancer for the APIs. [Refer to the NGINX documentation for more details.](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/load-balancer/http-load-balancer/)

## Producer Control Switch

The Producer Control Switch is a device (normally a PC) that has exclusive access to all the Producers. Its function is to access the producer plugin in order to do operations like stop/pause some producer, switch to the fail over producer, check the producer status, check the peer status and other very important actions related to the producer management. 

The main idea is to have all Block Producer's producer nodes able to produce (with the producer plugin enabled, signature, etc), but the backup producer will be in pause mode. If something happens to the main producer or some maintenance procedures needs to be done, the Block Producer can switch to the backup producer until the main one is stabilized. This management can be done automatically, using a NodeJS script to handle the main and the backup producer or manually.

# Infrastructure and Network Overview

## Network Schema

The diagrams below show how a network should be set up based on the architectural guidelines.

### Connection Types Legend

These are the connection types used in the following diagrams.

![](/images/network-infrastructure.png)

### Overall Network Topology

The following overall network topology hides some details to give a focus on the big picture.

![](/images/nodeos-infrastructure.png)

### A single cluster of producing infrastructure from a block producer

Here is a more detailed view of a single cluster, which has its API machines connected to a load balancer via an HTTP connection and its producing machines connected via a Wireguard/VPN connection.

![](/images/vpn-network.png)

### A link to the miro board with more details

[https://miro.com/app/board/o9J\_koVWOmk=/](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_koVWOmk=/)

## Summary

A cluster in the diagram above corresponds to the infrastructure that each partner Block Producer is expected to set up on their side. This document aims to walk you through the steps required to achieve this. A Block Producer can use the [Minimum recommended infrastructure](./minimum-recommended-infrastructure.md) as a guide for what kind of hardware Ultra currently requires. As the Mainnet grows and scales, this configuration is likely to change over time and require an infrastructure upgrade.

### Connection type

Some connections are **block-only** to prevent unnecessary transaction propagation and reduce the chance of send duplicate transactions. e.g. connections between the API nodeos.

### API nodeos configuration

API nodeos doesn't accept p2p transactions, that is **p2p-accept-transactions = false**, to prevent a transaction is sent from a producing nodeos to its own API nodeos.

## Guide for adding more BPs into the schema

### Peer numbers

The maximum peer limits for any producing nodeos is 10 for performance reasons. Normally, it connects to 5 other nodeos in the following priority.

1.  Previous and next producer nodeos in the production schedule
    
2.  Connect to other 3 producer nodeos from the rest producers, based on lower latency first rule.
    
### Hop numbers

Basically, one hop means from one nodeos to another nodeos. The network schema should minimize the hops between the producing nodeos. Ideally, all producing nodeos should connect to each other directly, so a block can be sent to other Block Producers with the smallest delay. However, since there's the recommended maximum 10 peers limit, it’s impossible to do that. Instead, the network schema should try to limit the hops between the producing nodeos to the smallest number of hops possible. With 5 Block Producers, we can connect each producing nodeos directly, i.e one hop. With 8 Block Producers, we can limit it to 2 hops between the producing nodeos.

## Adding more API nodeos

Conditions on adding more API nodeos

*   There is a high number of HTTP requests that transactions can’t get a response in time, e.g. 2 seconds
    
*   There is a high number of public peers that would break the maximum peer limit.  
    
## Load Balancer

It’s recommended to use HAProxy for both HTTP and TPC load balancer.

title: 'Minimum Infrastructure'

outline: [0,4]
order: -98

# Miniumum Infrastructure

It is the Block Producer’s prerogative whether to run their servers on their own hardware or through a bare-metal service like Amazon AWS or Google Cloud.

**Minimum required nodes**

-   1 producer node    
-   2 seed / API nodes
-   1 producer node as a backup
    

**A note on RAM**

If you spawn too many API nodes you can potentially crash the environment by simply running out of **RAM**. Please account for RAM usage when you spawn additional API nodes under the same environment.

### Intel Platform Machines

| Node Type             | Number of Nodes | Server Info                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API / Seed Node       | 2               | Intel Xeon-E 2288G / 16t 3.7GHz - 5Ghz, 64GB DDR4 ECC 2666MHz RAM, 2 x 960GB SSD NVMe Soft RAID, Public Network 500Mbps unmetered (burst 1Gbs), Private Network 500Mbps |
| Producing Node        | 1               | Intel Xeon-E 2274G / 8t 4GHz - 4.7Ghz, 64GB DDR4 ECC 2666MHz RAM, 2 x 960GB SSD NVMe Soft RAID, Public Network 500Mbps unmetered (burst 1Gbs), Private Network 500Mbps  |
| Backup Producing Node | 1               | Intel Xeon-E 2274G / 8t 4GHz - 4.7Ghz, 64GB DDR4 ECC 2666MHz RAM, 2 x 960GB SSD NVMe Soft RAID, Public Network 500Mbps unmetered (burst 1Gbs), Private Network 500Mbps  |

## Networking details

Certain ports need to be opened on your instance’s firewall.

-  SSH 22
    
-  HTTP 80
    
-  HTTPS 443
    
-  NODEOS 9876
    
-  WIREGUARD 45888
    

Only your API / Seed Node should have an exposed endpoint to the outside world. This is to ensure your producing nodes will continue producing regardless of network load.

**A note on IP addresses**

Ultra recommends requires all Block Producers use static external IPs for all instances.

# Templates for Config

## Benchmarking Config - Producer / API

This is the configuration file that we used doing our benchmarking tests. This should not be used in production and should only be used for benchmarking local chains, or stress testing the network. The configurations for Producer and APIs need to target all available endpoints for pushing transactions through.

```typescript
chain-state-db-size-mb = 4096
chain-state-db-guard-size-mb = 256

agent-name = "Producer"

max-clients = 0
p2p-max-nodes-per-host = 10

chain-threads = 4
producer-threads = 4

http-server-address = 127.0.0.1:8888
p2p-listen-endpoint = bhs-infra-1:9876

# peers
# producers
p2p-peer-address = <host>:<port>
p2p-peer-address = <host>:<port>

# api
p2p-peer-address = <host>:<port>
p2p-peer-address = <host>:<port>
p2p-peer-address = <host>:<port>
p2p-peer-address = <host>:<port>
p2p-peer-address = <host>:<port>
p2p-peer-address = <host>:<port>

enable-stale-production  = true
pause-on-startup = false

max-transaction-time = 5000
http-max-response-time-ms = 30000

producer-name = <BLOCKCHAIN_NAME_ID_ETC>
signature-provider = <public>=KEY:<private_key>

plugin = eosio::chain_api_plugin
plugin = eosio::net_api_plugin
plugin = eosio::producer_api_plugin

wasm-runtime=eos-vm-jit
eos-vm-oc-enable=true
```

## API Node Template

This is a general template you should be running for your producing node. Keep in mind that it should be connected solely to your producer node and all other APIs.

```typescript
chain-state-db-size-mb = 4096
chain-state-db-guard-size-mb = 256

agent-name = "API"
max-clients = 0
p2p-max-nodes-per-host = 10

http-threads = 6
chain-threads = 4
# http not listening on localhost because of nginx HA setup
http-server-address = <YOUR_HOST:YOUR_PORT>
p2p-listen-endpoint = <YOUR_HOST:YOUR_PORT>

# OTHER APIs
p2p-peer-address = <HOST:PORT>
p2p-peer-address = <HOST:PORT>
p2p-peer-address = <HOST:PORT>
p2p-peer-address = <HOST:PORT>
p2p-peer-address = <HOST:PORT>
p2p-peer-address = <HOST:PORT>
p2p-peer-address = <HOST:PORT>
p2p-peer-address = <HOST:PORT>

# YOUR PRODUCER
p2p-peer-address = <HOST:PORT>

http-validate-host = false

access-control-allow-origin = *
access-control-allow-headers = *
access-control-allow-credentials = true

plugin = eosio::history_api_plugin
plugin = eosio::chain_api_plugin

wasm-runtime=eos-vm-jit
eos-vm-oc-enable=true
```

## Producer Node Template

This is the general template you should be running for your producer node. This node should only be connected to other producers and your own API nodes.

```typescript
chain-state-db-size-mb = 4096
chain-state-db-guard-size-mb = 256

agent-name = "Producer"
max-clients = 0
p2p-max-nodes-per-host = 10

chain-threads = 4
producer-threads = 4

http-server-address = 127.0.0.1:<YOUR_PORT>
p2p-listen-endpoint = <YOUR_HOST:YOUR_PORT>

# YOUR API Endpoints
p2p-peer-address = <HOST:PORT>
p2p-peer-address = <HOST:PORT>

enable-stale-production  = true
pause-on-startup = false

max-transaction-time = 5000
http-max-response-time-ms = 30000

producer-name = <BLOCKCHAIN_NAME_ID_ETC>
signature-provider= <public>=KEY:<private_key>

plugin = eosio::chain_api_plugin
plugin = eosio::net_api_plugin
plugin = eosio::producer_api_plugin

wasm-runtime=eos-vm-jit
eos-vm-oc-enable=true
```

## Parameters Explained

### wasm-runtime

Override the default runtime.

```typescript
eos-vm | eos-vm-jit 
```

### eos-vm-oc-enable

Enable optimized runtime for WASM.

```typescript
0 | 1
```

### signature-provider

This should only be present in your producer node. This should be your private key and public key for your producer account. This allows you to properly produce blocks.

```typescript
<public>=KEY:<private_key>
```

### producer-name

The account name of the producer that is controlled by this node.

```typescript
producer-name = <BLOCKCHAIN_NAME_ID_ETC>
```

### p2p-peer-address

A public endpoint of a peer node to connect to.

```typescript
p2p-peer-address = <ip>:<port>
```

### p2p-listen-endpoint

The actual host/port used to listen for incoming p2p connections.

```typescript
p2p-listen-endpoint = <ip>:<port>
```

### max-clients

The maximum number of clients that can connect to this node. Use **0** for unlimited.

```typescript
max-clients = 0
```

### p2p-max-nodes-per-host

The maximum number of nodes allowed to connect to this node from a single IP address.

```typescript
p2p-max-nodes-per-host = 1
```

# Understanding the Config

Ultra provides [Templates for config.ini](./templates-for-config.md), but a good way for you to better understand _nodeos_ software is to look into its help options or scroll through the _config.ini_ file and search for configurations that may fit your needs. Below you will find listed only the basic configurations needed for your operation.

## Set Block Producer's name

Set the producer-name option to your blockchain account.

The blockchain account will be provided to Block Producers by Ultra

```typescript
producer-name = BP_EOS_ACCOUNT
```

## Set Block Producer's signature provider

You will need to set the signature keys for your Block Producer. By now you should have created a key pair specifically for this using cleos. For further details, please refer to the [Account Administration](../maintenance/account-administration.md) section.

```typescript
signature-provider = PUBLIC_SIGNING_KEY=KEY:PRIVATE_SIGNING_KEY
```

## Set Block Producer's server address

Here you should set your node IP address.

```typescript
p2p-server-address = YOUR_NODE_IP_ADDRESS:PORT
```

## Define peers list

Here you should define all peers that your nodeos instance is in communication with. Ideally, you want to keep your Producer node IP secret. Most Block Producers have several API/seed nodes that hide their producer node as described before. The producer-only peers with the API/seed node.

```typescript
p2p-peer-address = PEER_NODE_IP_ADDRESS:PORT
```

## New WASM Runtime

After Antelope v1.9 there were major performance increases for Antelope in general. We’ll be utilizing those performance increases in our chain and we can directly enable some of those performance increases with the following two parameters. [Read more about EOS-VM performance increases.](https://eos.io/news/eos-virtual-machine-a-high-performance-blockchain-webassembly-interpreter/)

```typescript
wasm-runtime=eos-vm-jit
eos-vm-oc-enable=true
```

## Load the required plugins

Here the configuration changes according to the node type. For your Producer nodes, you need to enable at least the Producer and the Producer API plugins. For the Full and API nodes, enable Chain API and State History plugins as well in addition to the aforementioned. See the listing below as a reference for the Full and API nodes: 

```typescript
plugin = eosio::producer_plugin
plugin = eosio::producer_api_plugin
plugin = eosio::chain_api_plugin
plugin = eosio::http_plugin
plugin = eosio::history_plugin
plugin = eosio::history_api_plugin
```

# Activating the Chain

## Difference from Antelope

Ultra is responsible for activating the chain and the `ultra` account is the only account that can activate the chain. It is important to understand that instead of having `eosio` account relieve its permissions we opted instead for the `ultra` account to complete this task.

## How to Activate

Once everything is verified for the resignation of accounts; we can do a final step to activate the chain.

This is the final step before the producers begin **PRODUCING** blocks.

```typescript
cleos push action eosio activatechn '[]' -p ultra
```

title: 'Adding Producers'

outline: [0,4]
order: -92
---

# Adding Producers

Our system contract modifications prevent any form of voting after the chain has been activated. This modification precludes the standard procedure on Antelope for adding additional Block Producers to our network.

Ultra handpicks the Block Producers and adds them manually through **regprod** and **unregprod** actions. Once these actions are performed, the modifications to the block production schedule are handled automatically.

## How Producers are Activated

When a producer is registered and they have registered themselves Ultra can add them through an action. Ultra is responsible for creating the production schedule, which is done through the `setprods` action.

title: 'Launch Procedure Concepts'

outline: [0,4]
order: -99
---

# Launch Procedure Concepts

## What is a genesis node?

The genesis node, on an Antelope network, is the first node that sets up the network and produces the first blocks. It is responsible for setting up the system contracts, registering the first batch of Block Producers on the network, and passing the block production on to them.

In short, the genesis node starts the network and then passes off responsibility to the Block Producers. The genesis will eventually shut itself down after the responsibility is passed off to the Block Producers to keep the network running.

## How will Ultra set up their genesis node?

Ultra will be responsible for setting up their genesis node with a handful of contracts. Ultra will also be responsible for ensuring the genesis node is synchronized to our block producers through their wire-guard configurations. We will also be provided a modified version of the `genesis.json` file for our block producers to utilize when they are booting up their individual nodes.  
  
Here’s a list of smart contracts that will be deployed by Ultra’s genesis node and what their general functionality will provide. Additional contracts that Ultra will utilize will be launched by Ultra at future dates once the chain’s responsibility has been passed on.

#### eosio.system

This contract will provide the creation of user-owned accounts, distribution of chain resources such as RAM, CPU, and NET, and maintain the block producer schedule. Which you can find more about below.

#### eosio.token

This contract will provide the ability for users and ultra alike to create fungible tokens such as **UOS** which will be the chain’s main currency. Unlike other chains, Ultra makes it much easier to deploy a currency without having to redeploy the entire `eosio.token` contract.

#### eosio.msig

This contract provides a way for multiple users to sign single or multiple transactions that need approval from multiple users. This multi-signature contract is great for handling permissions between a single account that needs approval from multiple accounts before an action may be executed.

## The Block Producer Schedule

### How many Block Producers will there be on the Ultra Blockchain?

There will initially be five Block Producers on the Ultra Blockchain.

### Who defines the Block Producer schedule?

During the initial Testnets and Mainnet, it will be Ultra who is defining the Block Producer schedule. There is not an ordered, elected ranking like on other Antelope chains. There is no voting for Block Producers.

### What will be the procedure for changes to the block producer schedule?

Changes to the block producer schedule will be announced on-chain and Block Producers will need to approve the change. This will happen when a Block Producer leaves the chain, or a new one is added.

title: 'Finishing Up'

outline: [0,4]
order: -93
---

# Finishing Up

After activating the chain state, it is important to speak with the other Block Producers and ensure they are producing blocks on their end. Screenshots and other forms of data sharing should be used to validate that the network is running as intended.

Follow-ups via the provided private Slack channel are also very important to ensure everything is running smoothly and communication lines are open both between the Block Producers and Ultra.

Once everything is running smoothly, Block Producers may expose their api endpoints as necessary.
---
title: 'Registering Block Producers'

outline: [0,4]
order: -96
---

# Registering Block Producers

## Obtaining a Private and Public Key Pair

Each Block Producer must provide Ultra with a public key that they will generate locally.

It is highly recommended that when you generate these keys that the private key is stored in a safe location. Please formulate a plan to keep this private key a secret. We refer you to [Account administration](../maintenance/account-administration.md) for more details.

### To output the key pair to the console.

```typescript
cleos create key --to-console
```

### To save the key pair to file

```typescript
cleos create key --file FILE_TO_SAVEKEY
```

Ultra will then create the Block Producers' accounts with the Block Producer’s public key.

Once this is done; Ultra can use the following command to create an account for them.

```typescript
cleos system newaccount ultra <account_name> <public_key> --transfer --stake-net "0.00000000 UOS" --stake-cpu "0.00000000 UOS" --gift-ram-kbytes <determine_kbytes_to_buy> -p ultra --ultra-id <ultra_id>
```

Block Producers must be registered through Ultra and will need to synchronize their chains up with the genesis nodeos. Once synchronized and the Block Producer is receiving blocks successfully, they can request for Ultra to register them on the network.

## Block Producer Checklist

Here are some things that block producers will be providing to Ultra for their genesis node.

*   Wireguard IP / Port
    
*   Endpoint Address
    
*   Public Key for Producer
    

Once they are provided; Ultra can easily register them. This can be done through the following command.

```typescript
cleos push action eosio regproducer '["<account_name>","<public_key>","<url>",<location>]' -p ultra 
```

Once this is done, Ultra can verify the current producers by checking the following table.

```typescript
cleos get table eosio eosio producers
```

# Resigning EOSIO and System Accounts

Once the network has 3 producers actively producing blocks for the chain; Ultra can move on to resigning the `eosio` account permissions to the producers.

Ultra will also need to go through and only let `eosio` control the system accounts. This is a precaution to ensure that all system accounts are only controlled by `eosio`.

## Resigning System Accounts

The first thing we’ll do is resign `eosio` and give privileges to `eosio.wrap` and `eosio.msig`.

```typescript
cleos push action eosio setpriv '["eosio.msig", 1]' -p eosio@active
cleos push action eosio setpriv '["eosio.wrap", 1]' -p eosio@active
```

## Resigning EOSIO Account

After we can do the final update of authorization on `eosio` by resigning all permissions to the `eosio.prods` account.

```typescript
cleos push action eosio updateauth '{"account": "eosio", "permission": "owner", "parent": "", "auth": {"threshold": 1, "keys": [], "waits": [], "accounts": [{"weight": 1, "permission": {"actor": "eosio.prods", "permission": "active"}}]}}' -p eosio@owner

cleos push action eosio updateauth '{"account": "eosio", "permission": "active", "parent": "owner", "auth": {"threshold": 1, "keys": [], "waits": [], "accounts": [{"weight": 1, "permission": {"actor": "eosio.prods", "permission": "active"}}]}}' -p eosio@active
```

outline: [0,4]
order: -98

# Setting Up Genesis Node

While you are reading this article keep in mind that these are steps that Ultra will be performing on their Genesis Node. These are not steps that are going to be taken by the Block Producers.

The Ultra system token is **UOS** and has a decimal count of **4**. This will be used to launch the system contract and ensure everything is synchronized between the eosio.token contract and eosio.system contract.

Ultra will be providing pre-compiled contract ABIs and WASMs.

**Important:** Before launch, any default chain parameters inside of the source files need to be **DISCUSSED** and **ADJUSTED** before the system contract is used.

## Creating System Accounts

The first thing that we’re going to do is create the system accounts. Here’s a full list of the system accounts.

*   eosio
    
*   eosio.token
    
*   eosio.system
    
*   eosio.msig
    
*   eosio.ram: store ram payment
    
*   eosio.ramfee: store ram fee
    
*   eosio.stake: store staked token
    
*   eosio.wrap: for the wrap contract
    
*   ultra: ultra root account
    

**Note:** All of the accounts should be placed under the same genesis key **except** for **ULTRA**. As these accounts will eventually forfeit their permissions to the producers. The creation of these accounts can be done through the following action.

```typescript
cleos create account eosio <account_name>
```

We will ensure that all accounts are created by checking them manually.

```typescript
cleos get account <account_name>
```

**Accounts which EOS mainnet use whereas ultra doesn't**

*   eosio.rex, as we don't have res
    
*   eosio.names, as we don't have premium name policy yet, no name bidding
    
*   eosio.saving, as we don't have extra inflation, so we don't need the saving account
    
*   eosio.bpay: producers' block reward, as we inflate token when doing reward for each BP, we don't need the cache
    
*   eosio.vpay
    

## Setting Up for Chain Feature Activation

The chain features must be manually activated before launch; here’s how we can do that.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8888/v1/producer/schedule_protocol_feature_activations -d '{"protocol_features_to_activate": ["0ec7e080177b2c02b278d5088611686b49d739925a92d9bfcacd7fc6b74053bd"]}' | jq
```

## Initializing the BIOS Contract

The BIOS contract must be deployed on eosio before we continue any further.

Ultra provides a compiled version of this contract.

```typescript
cleos set contract eosio ./eosio.contracts/contracts/eosio.bios.x.x.x eosio.bios.wasm eosio.bios.abi -p eosio
```

## Activating the Chain Features

These chain features must be activated manually. In order, the following features are going to be activated.

*   GET\_SENDER
    
*   FORWARD\_SETCODE
    
*   ONLY\_BILL\_FIRST\_AUTHORIZER
    
*   RESTRICT\_ACTION\_TO\_SELF
    
*   DISALLOW\_EMPTY\_PRODUCER\_SCHEDULE
    
*   FIX\_LINKAUTH\_RESTRICTION
    
*   REPLACE\_DEFERRED
    
*   NO\_DUPLICATE\_DEFERRED\_ID
    
*   ONLY\_LINK\_TO\_EXISTING\_PERMISSION
    
*   RAM\_RESTRICTIONS
    
*   WEBAUTHN\_KEYS
    
*   WTMSIG\_BLOCK\_SIGNATURES
    

```typescript
cleos push action eosio activate '["f0af56d2c5a48d60a4a5b5c903edfb7db3a736a94ed589d0b797df33ff9d3e1d"]' -p eosio

```

We will verify all of these are activated by running the following command.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8888/v1/producer/get_supported_protocol_features -d '{}' | jq
```

## Initialize Base Contracts

We’re first going to initialize the **eosio.token** and **eosio.msig** contracts. This is entirely dependent on the directory you are in, but it should be a similar process. Ensure the keys for the accounts are inside of your wallet at this time.

After we’ll start with setting both the eosio.token and eosio.msig contracts. We’ll be using the ‘eosio.contracts/contracts’ the folder in this reference.

```typescript
cleos set contract eosio.token ./eosio.token

cleos set contract eosio.msig ./eosio.msig
```

After that, we'll be adding some permissions to the token account.

```typescript
cleos set account permission eosio.token active --add-code eosio.token owner -p eosio.token
cleos set account permission ultra active --add-code eosio.token owner -p ultra
```

Then we’ll initialize the actual eosio.token contract immediately after; putting reserved symbols into the eosio.token table.

```typescript
cleos push action eosio.token init '[]' -p ultra
```

Then we’ll initialize the system currency. Please replace **MAX\_SUPPLY** with the maximum tokens agreed upon in the IEO, which was 1,000,000,000 tokens.

```typescript
cleos push action eosio.token create '["ultra","1000000000.0000 UOS"]' -p ultra
```

Ultra needs to take into consideration their token pre-sale. This should match the pre-sale numbers and will be distributed after launch.

```typescript
cleos push action eosio.token issue '["ultra","AMOUNT.0000 UOS", "Init"]' -p ultra
```

## Initialize the System Contract

We’ll start off by setting the contract for the account **eosio**.

```typescript
cleos set contract eosio ./eosio.system
```

After setting this contract we need to initialize the system contract with our currency. Remember that we’re using `8` for the precision of our system currency.

```typescript
cleos push action eosio init '[0,"8,UOS"]' -f -p eosio
```

We also cannot forget to reserve some RAM for ultra.

```typescript
cleos push action eosio resvrambytes '["1073741824"]' -p ultra
```

## Registering New Accounts

At this point, we will need to register accounts for our Block Producer partners. Our Block Producer partners will need to provide their account names as well as their public key. We will use the system contract to make new accounts from this point forward.

```typescript
cleos system newaccount ultra <account_name> <public_key> --transfer --stake-net "0.00000000 UOS" --stake-cpu "0.00000000 UOS" --gift-ram-kbytes 4k -p ultra
```

## Resigning Genesis Account to Block Producers

At this stage we will be resigning our genesis account and removing all of the associated permissions. The **eosio.system** contract will be distributing its permissions to our Block Producers from here on in. After this step Ultra will no longer be responsible for anything that the system contract does and it will be fully automated by the block production schedule.

There are additional details on how this is done in the following article: [Resigning eosio and system accounts](./resigning-eosio-and-system-accounts.md)

title: 'Genesis Node Sync'

outline: [0,4]

# Synchronizing with Genesis Node

## Connecting to the Genesis Node

Ultra will provide a configuration with all Wireguard IPs that will allow our Block Producers to synchronize with each other and the Genesis node. This will help smooth out the process of getting all of our Block Producers connected and streamlining our network launch.

## Retrieving the Genesis Configuration

The `genesis.json` is used as a starting point for the chain and is used to ensure that our Block Producers are synchronizing properly with Ultra’s genesis node. Ultra will be providing the `genesis.json` to utilize at the time of launch.

Here’s an example configuration. Ensure that **max\_inline\_action\_depth** is set to the value that is decided upon before launch.

**Important:** The following **genesis.json** needs to take into account the **‘ultra\_veto\_enabled’** configuration. This is incredibly important for the chain launch as it is required functionality for our enterprise solution.

```json
{
    "initial_timestamp": "2018-09-01T12:00:00.000",
    "initial_key": "EOS6MRyAjQq8ud7hVNYcfnVPJqcVpscN5So8BhtHuGYqET5GDW5CV",
    "initial_configuration": {
      	"max_block_net_usage": 1048576,
		"target_block_net_usage_pct": 1000,
		"max_transaction_net_usage": 524288,
		"base_per_transaction_net_usage": 12,
		"net_usage_leeway": 500,

		"context_free_discount_net_usage_den": 100,
		"max_block_cpu_usage": 200000,
		"target_block_cpu_usage_pct": 1000,
		"max_transaction_cpu_usage": 150000,
		"min_transaction_cpu_usage": 100,
		"free_cpu_basis_point": 6000,
		"free_net_basis_point": 6000,
		"ultra_veto_enabled": 1,
		"max_transaction_lifetime": 3600,

		"max_inline_action_size": 4096,
		"max_inline_action_depth": 4,
		"max_authority_depth": 6
    }
}.
```

## Initial Key Pair

**initial\_key** should be unique, and will be used to launch the genesis nodeos; only **Ultra** should be aware of the private initial key. You will be sent a public key by Ultra to put in place of the **initial\_key**.

## Initial Chain ID

The Chain ID is now derived by the configuration after starting the network. This Chain ID will be passed to the Block Producers to ensure that they all are connecting to the same network.

title: 'Account Administration'

outline: [0,4]
order: -99
---

# Account Administration

Every Block Producer needs to be able to manage his keys in a secure and efficient manner for the sake of his own security and security of the Ultra Blockchain. As a best practice every BP account must at least use 4 key pairs:

1.  **Owner keys:** This is the root permission, proving ownership of your account. These keys can be used to replace keys on any other permission. Owner keys should be stored securely and only used in emergencies.
    
2.  **Active keys:** Used for signing and executing transactions and also for pushing actions. Should be kept secure and used with caution.
    
3.  **Signature keys:** A key pair that is used only for signing blocks. It must not be used to perform any other operation.
    
4.  **Claim keys:** A key pair that is used only for claiming rewards.
    

Make sure to create these four key pairs and store them securely.

**Recommended storage of keypairs**

For the Owner and Active keypairs, we recommend storing these on a hardware wallet like a Ledger which requires a second physical step for authorization.

The Signature and Claim keys can be stored securely according to the internal security policies of the Block Producers. The Signature keypair can not be stored on a hardware wallet as it needs to be input into nodeos.

When you finish this setup, you should update the signature provider record in your config.ini file with your new signature keys.

You should also create a new permission called claim using your claim keys. Don't forget to link the _claimrewards_ action to this new permission. This way, your claim keys can only be used to claim rewards. This process is described below:

### Create the custom claim permission as a child of the active permission

```typescript
cleos set account permission YOURACCOUNT claim CLAIM_PUBLIC_KEY active -p YOURACCOUNT@active​
```

### Link claimrewards action to the claim permission

```typescript
cleos set action permission YOURACCOUNT eosio claimrewards claim -p YOURACCOUNT@active
```

### Claiming the rewards with claim permission

```typescript
cleos system claimrewards YOURACCOUNT -p YOURACCOUNT@claim
```

### Removing the claim permission

```typescript
cleos set account permission YOURACCOUNT claim NULL active -p YOURACCOUNT@active
cleos set action permission YOURACCOUNT eosio claimrewards NULL -p YOURACCOUNT@active
```

title: 'Backup and Recovery'

outline: [0,4]
order: -97
---

# Backup and Recovery

Nodeos provides various options for replaying blockchain blocks. This can be very useful to recover a node instance from some failure as it can quickly catch up with the network instead of having to synchronize from the p2p network.

Replaying data can be done in two ways:

*   **From a blocks.log file**  
    The blocks log file contains all irreversible transactions on the blockchain. All instances of nodeos write irreversible blocks to the blocks.log file, which is located data/blocks directory relative to the nodeos data directory. Using a blocks.log file to replay will allow you to start a nodeos instance which recreates the entire history of the blockchain locally, without adding unnecessary load to the network.
    
*   **From a snapshot file**  
    Snapshot files can be created from a running nodeos instance. The snapshot contains the chain state for the current head block. Snapshot files should only be used if the head block they represent is irreversible. Using a snapshot file to replay allows you to quickly start a nodeos instance which has a full and correct chain state at a specified block number, but not a full history of transactions up to that block number. From that point on the nodeos instance will operate in the configured manner.
    

**Ultra provides two scripts:** 

*   **Nodeos-launcher script:** start your node and do automatically recovering from failures. 
    
*   **Snapshot-creator script:** responsible for making regular snapshots. 
    

It is important for you to understand how the process works so we will go over these two ways in detail.

## Getting a blocks.log file

The blocks.log file is used by nodeos to persist irreversible blocks. The default location for this file is in the data/blocks directory. However, the data directory can be specified using the -d \[ --data-dir \] option on the nodeos command line

You can also download a block.log file from other Block Producers over the network.

## Replay from blocks log

Once you have a copy of the blocks.log file which you wish to replay the blockchain from, copy it to your data/blocks directory. You should back up any existing contents of this directory if you wish to keep them. After that, start nodeos with one of the following replay-blockchain options:

```typescript
--replay-blockchain
```

This option tells nodeos to replay from the blocks.log file located in the data/blocks directory. Nodeos will clear the chain state and replay all blocks.

```typescript
--hard-replay-blockchain
```

This option tells nodeos to replay from the blocks.log file located in the data/blocks directory. Nodeos makes a backup of the existing blocks.log file and will then clear the chain state and replay all blocks. This option assumes that the backup blocks.log file may contain corrupted blocks, so nodeos replays as many blocks as possible from the backup block log. Nodeos will then synchronize the rest of the blockchain from the p2p network.

| location               | name               | action                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| data/blocks            | blocks.index       | remove                                                   |
| data/blocks            | blocks.log         | replace this file with the blocks.log you want to replay |
| data/blocks/reversible | forkdb.dat         | remove                                                   |
| data/blocks/reversible | shared_memory.bin  | remove                                                   |
| data/blocks/reversible | shared_memory.meta | remove                                                   |


You can use blocks-dir = "blocks" in the configuration file or using the

```typescript
--blocks-dir
```

command-line option, to specify where to find the blocks.log to replay.

## Triggering the creation of a snapshot

Snapshots can be created at runtime using the RPC available through the Producer API plugin. For example:

```typescript
http://you_server:your_http_port/v1/producer/create_snapshot
```

Will create a snapshot of the data/snapshots directory.

Replay from snapshot

Once you have a copy of a valid snapshot file from which you wish to create a valid chain state, copy it to your data/snapshots directory, backing up (if you wish to keep them), and removing any existing contents of the data directory. After that, start nodeos with the

```typescript
-snapshot
```

option to specify the name of the snapshot to replay.

When replaying from a snapshot file it is recommended that all existing data is removed, however, if a blocks.log is provided it must at least contain blocks up to the snapshotted block and may contain additional blocks that will be applied as part of the startup. If a blocks.log file exists, but does not contain blocks up to and/or after the snapshotted block then replaying from a snapshot will create an exception. Any available reversible blocks will also be applied.

| blocks.log               | snapshot                    | action                                                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| no blocks.log            | for irreversible block 2000 | ok                                                     |
| contains blocks 1 - 1999 | for irreversible block 2000 | exception                                              |
| contains blocks 1 - 2001 | for irreversible block 2000 | ok - will recreate from snapshot and 'play' block 2001 |

When instantiating a node from a snapshot, it is illegal to pass in any _genesis_ arguments as that information is loaded from a snapshot. If a blocks.log exists, the genesis information it contains will be validated against the genesis data in the snapshot will throw an error if they are not consistent.

**Note**  
Instantiating a node from a snapshot without a blocks.log file is valid but it will create a partial blocks.log which will affect the ability to service any requests for block data as it will not be available.

## Calculating an integrity hash

Integrity hashes are a way of comparing the contents of the blockchain state database. They consist of a sha256 hash of a deterministic binary representation of all consensus affecting state and can be retrieved at runtime using the RPC available through the Producer API plugin. For example:

```typescript
http://you_server:your_http_port/v1/producer/get_integrity_hash
```

title: 'Launching an Instance'

outline: [0,4]
order: -98
---

# Launching an Instance

Before the nodeos launcher script is executed, it is important to create a wallet using _cleos_. The wallet will import and maintain all the keys that shall be required by the Block Producer. It is important that all the private keys generated in the [Account Administration](./account-administration.md) section are imported to this wallet. The commands for creating a wallet and importing the keys are given below.

```typescript
cleos wallet create --name YOUR_WALLET_NAME --file WALLET_PASSWD_FILE
cleos wallet import --name YOUR_WALLET_NAME --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
```

**Please note** that it is not a requirement to run _cleos_ and have a wallet on all of the node instances, however, this is a _requirement_ for [Synchronizing with Genesis Node](../launch-procedures/synchronizing-with-genesis-node.md) .

It is important to save the password for your wallet in a file and keep it secure. Once the unlocked wallet has not been used for more than 15 minutes (the default timeout duration) _cleos_ is locks your wallet as a safety measure.

If you attempt to run a command using the wallet, it will be required to unlock it first by providing the password. 

In addition to the aforementioned, you are also required to create a genesis.json file for being able to launch your block producer in the genesis mode.

Finally, it is time to run your node. To run nodeos, all you will need to do is to run the start script provided by Ultra. Nodeos will replay the blockchain and after some time will start the block production process.

Once that process is running, you will be able to interact with the blockchain.

title: 'MSIG Proposals'

outline: [0,4]

# MSIG Proposals

Making proposals on-chain requires both Ultra and Block Producers to approve a proposal. A proposal is a series of actions and/or changes that are meant to be executed at the time of approval. Once Ultra and Block Producers approve of these changes then the code gets executed.

### Important steps before resignation to eosio.msigs

We need to do **setpriv** on the **eosio.msig** contract to allow it to be handled by other Block Producers. The following line will solve the issue, and allow other Block Producers to control the **eosio.prods** account properly.

```typescript
cleos push action eosio setpriv '["eosio.msig", 1]' -p eosio@active
```

## Creating a Proposal

Proposals use the multisig option inside of the built-in cleos interface. It can be done through the following action.

```typescript
cleos multisig propose <proposal_name> <requested_permissions> <trx_permissions> <contract> <action> <data> <proposer> <proposal_exp_in_hours>
```

*   **Proposal\_Name**
    
    *   The name of the proposal.
        
    *   Needs to be less than or equal to 12 characters.
        
    *   Needs to follow standard EOS name rules.
        
*   **Requested\_Permissions**
    
    *   A JSON String or filename defining requested permissions.
        
*   **Trx\_Permission**
    
    *   A JSON string or filename defining transaction permissions.
        
*   **Contract**
    
    *   The contract in which the deferred transaction should go to.
        
*   **Action**
    
    *   The action for the deferred transaction.
        
*   **Data**
    
    *   A JSON string or filename defining the action to propose.
        
*   **Proposer**
    
    *   An account proposing the transaction.
        
*   **Proposal\_Expiration**
    
    *   The time in hours until this transaction becomes expired.
        
    *   Optional
        

**Example:**

```typescript
cleos multisig propose proposalname '[{"actor": "producacnt11", "permission": "active"}, {"actor": "producacnt12", "permission": "active"}, {"actor": "producacnt13", "permission": "active"}, {"actor": "ultra", "permission": "active"}]' '[{"actor": "eosio.prods", "permission": "active"}]' eosio setacctram '{"account":"producacnt11", "ram_bytes":"5000"}' -p ultra
```

An alternative to the above proposal is **propose\_trx** which is a more flexible version of the above code.

```typescript
cleos multisig propose_trx <name> <requested_perms> <json string or file> <proposer>
```

## Reviewing a Proposal

You can always review the current proposal by reviewing who originally published it and then seeing what permissions are required under

```typescript
cleos multisig review <proposer_name> <proposal_name>
```

**Example:**

```typescript
cleos multisig review ultra setacctrm
```

## Approving a Proposal

Proposals must be approved by both Ultra and a handful of producers on the chain. This can be done with the following action. Note that Ultra is required for EVERY proposal. Otherwise, it will not be approved.

```typescript
cleos multisig approve <proposer> <proposal_name> <permissions> <proposal_hash>
```

## Canceling a Proposal

Proposals can only be canceled by the original owner or Ultra. Ultra reserves special veto rights over proposals.

```typescript
cleos multisig cancel <proposer> <proposal_name>
```

**Example:**

```typescript
cleos multisig cancel ultra setacctram
```

## Invalidate

When a proposal is changed then it is often appropriate to invalidate all signatures on the contract. This can be done through the invalidate action.

```typescript
cleos multisig invalidate <invalidator_name>
```

**Example:**

```typescript
cleos multisig cancel ultra setacctram
```

# System Contract Upgrade

The system contract upgrade needs to go through a packed transaction action; that will get the transaction ready. Once the transaction is ready we send it up to eosio.msig contract and get it ready for all of the active BPs to vote upon. 

First, we need to pack the transaction and get it ready. This will output the transaction to a file. However, this step implies that the system contract is already compiled, and you’ve copied this data to a new folder and opened it up with a terminal.

```typescript
cleos set contract eosio ./ eosio.system.wasm eosio.system.abi -p eosio.prods -x 60000 -d -s |& tee upgrade.json
```

Here’s an example of **before**:

```typescript
"expiration": "2019-08-15T22:07:41"
```

Here’s an example of **after**:

```typescript
"expiration": "2019-08-17T22:07:41"
```

After completing this step; you’ll want to get a list of the current producers and set up a file of ‘potential’ permissions that will be necessary to get this contract upgraded with Ultra’s permission. The way that we can do this is to run a simple command and then paste the following line of code; copy the below code first and modify it where necessary.

**Template**:

```typescript
[{"actor": "producer1", "permission": "active"}, {"actor": "ultra", "permission": "active"}]
```

**Example:**

```typescript
[{"actor": "producacnt11", "permission": "active"}, {"actor": "producacnt12", "permission": "active"},{"actor": "ultra", "permission": "active"}]
```

Once your template is ready to type the following and paste your modified permissions JSON.

```typescript
cat > perms.json
```

After it is pasted inside; press ctrl+c and that’ll cancel the editing and save the file. You can always re-open to ensure the permissions made it inside.

Now we’re ready to push up the proposal for the upgrade.

## Deploying the Multi-Signature Transaction

Instead of using ‘propose’ from eosio.msig we’re going to use a different version. Inside the folder with your ‘.wasm’, ‘.abi’, and two ‘.json’ files we’ll use the following to deploy it.

```typescript
cleos multisig propose_trx upgradesys perms.json upgrade.json ultra -p ultra
```

Great! We can review this on-chain after it has been deployed.

```typescript
cleos multisig review ultra upgradesys
```

## Gather Signatures

One of the final steps is to gather signatures for this upgrade. We can do this by having our block producers approve of the upgrade. Here’s an example template for the cleos command they can run.

```typescript
cleos multisig approve ultra upgradesys '{"actor":"producacnt11","permission":"active"}' -p producacnt11

cleos multisig approve ultra upgradesys '{"actor":"producacnt12","permission":"active"}' -p producacnt12
```

Very easy to get an upgrade going.

## Final Step

After enough signatures are gathered and Ultra has also signed on to this proposal; we can execute the code.

```typescript
cleos multisig exec ultra upgrade -p ultra
```

The transaction is complete. Celebrate by checking the system tables or running some of the new system contract actions that may or may not have been included.

# Upgrade Procedures

This chapter explains how to upgrade the infrastructure, nodeos software, and the consensus protocol (hard fork).

## Infrastructure upgrade

As the UOS Mainnet grows and scales, the minimum infrastructure configuration is likely to change over time and require upgrades.

If your BP is running the [Minimum Infrastructure](../infrastructure/minimum-recommended-infrastructure.md) specified by Ultra, the first thing that a Block Producer should do is to split their nodes into separate instances. There will then be dedicated instances for each kind of node. Ex.: Create a new instance for seed node, and 2 other instances for the API nodes.

Creating a powerful instance and keeping the same architecture, running all nodes in the same instance, is also a possibility. IO operations and not processor speed is the most critical component in maintaining a healthy cluster of API nodes as well as producer node. Moving to a bare-metal infrastructure or a hybrid infrastructure model across bare-metal and cloud services should be a good option to improve a Block Producer’s performance.

Regardless of specific infrastructure strategies, the upgrade process is the same. Here are the steps:

1.  Create a new instance based on the Block Producer needs. Eg: with more RAM, more CPU, or more storage.
    
2.  Set up the instance for the kind of node that is supposed to run (API, Seed, or Producer).
    
3.  Sync it to the network
    
4.  Perform connectivity and performance tests (please refer to the [Finishing up](../launch-procedures/finishing-up.md) section)
    
5.  Switch to the new instance
    
6.  Turn off the old instance
    

## Nodeos upgrade

Nodeos software is in constant development, so upgrading it is a regular activity that Block Producers will have to do. It's very important to stay updated and running the latest nodeos software version to provide the best services for Ultra users.

If it is a major update that requires a hard fork, please refer to the **Consensus protocol upgrade** section below. The steps for moving to a new version of nodeos software released are: 

1.  It is indicated to first build, install, and run it in a local machine to check if everything is working properly. 
    
2.  Build it in the node's instance or transfer the binaries built on step 1.
    
3.  Create a new folder for the binaries. It's very important to keep the running version of nodeos, to play it back in case of errors switching to the new one.
    
4.  The process of upgrading nodeos is quite simple, just edit the start.sh script and point the nodeos path to the new folder.
    

A good practice is to first upgrade the seed node because it's easier and faster to restore in case of any problems and you don't compromise the producer and your API service. After, you should upgrade the APIs, each at once, and finally, the producer. If the Block Producer has a producer node as a backup, switch to the backup producer, do the upgrade and switch back to the upgraded node. If not, producer nodes can do upgrade during a time window after they finished the last block and wait for the next turn. Block Producers make several blocks at a time, so they mostly wait until all other Block Producers complete their work. It should be enough time to stop and switch to the new version.

## Consensus protocol upgrade

If a release has major enhancements and a new consensus protocol feature has been introduced which requires changes to the protocol rules and alignment by block producing nodes for the upgrade to be successfully deployed, Ultra will provide detailed instructions on how to proceed to all Block Producers for each case. 

It's important to remember that before deploying these upgrades to the official network, each protocol upgrade feature should be deployed and verified on the Testnet. This test upgrade process can give Block Producers the practice by carrying out the steps necessary to successfully coordinate the activation of each feature.

title: 'NFT Contract Overview'

# NFT Overview

The abbreviation ‘NFT’ stands for Non-Fungible Token which means that NFT is a unit of data stored on a blockchain that can be sold or traded like other tokens. Unlike other tokens all NFTs are unique and one NFT cannot be replaced with another. That is why NFTs are often called `Uniqs`. In this document the NFTs can also be referred to as tokens.

The Ultra's `eosio.nft.ft` smart contract defines a set of data structures (multi index tables, singletons) and a set of blockchain actions to manipulate the data structures. Both the data structures and the actions implement the supported set of NFT Use cases.

## Info

NFT use cases describe what different users can do with NFTs. The text in **bold** represents actions, the text in _italic_ represents blockchain accounts and the `highlighted` text represents the related data structures or data structure elements. Please refer to the action description or data structure overview to obtain more information.

## Token Factory Creation

**PLEASE NOTE:** _Recall and Lockup feature will be disabled by default which means when creating new token factory, action will fail if you put any value for recall window or lockup time. This note will be removed when these features are enabled again._

The _Asset Creator_ and the _Asset Manager_ can **create.b** a token factory.

To issue a token, a token factory should be created first. For this version of `eosio.nft.ft` only _Ultra_ can be the _Asset Creator_ and the _Asset Manager_. A token factory is a set of blockchain data which provides settings for the NFTs issued with the factory. During the creation process it is required to set up several token parameters which control the NFTs parameters and the lifecycle - the NFTs off-chain metadata, minimum prices, reselling timeframes etc. All these data is stored in the `factory.b` table.

-   [create.b - create token factory](./nft-actions/create.b.md)
-   [factory.b](./nft-tables.md#factory-b)

## Issuing

The _Asset Manager_ can **issue.b** a token either to the _Asset Manager_ or to another _Account_.

The NFT issuance requires setting several parameters like the receiving _Account_ and the amount of tokens. The issued NFTs receive a global unique ID and a token factory recorded serial (ordinal) number. The issued token is recorded into the _Account_'s `token.b` table. The **issue.b** action reads and updates the data in the `factory.b` table.

-   [issue.b - issue tokens with token factory](./nft-actions/issue.b.md)
-   [factory.b](./nft-tables.md#factory-b)
-   [token.b](./nft-tables.md#token-b)

## Transferring

The token _Owner_ can **transfer** tokens to another _Account_.

An NFT _Owner_ can **transfer** their tokens to another _Account_. If the _Account_ is listed on the `conditionless_receivers` array of the token factory, no transfer checks are done. Otherwise the action is checked against the trading window and lock time limitations. The tables affected are `token.b` scoped to the sender and receiver accounts. The `factory.b` is read to obtain limitations.

-   [transfer - hand tokens over to another user](./nft-actions/transfer.md)
-   [token.b](./nft-tables.md#token-b)

## Selling

The token _Owner_ can **resell** tokens.

An NFT _Owner_ can **resell** their tokens on the resale marketplace specifying the desirable price. A resale promoter fee can be specified, the resale promoter will receive a fraction of the received funds. This action is a subject to the trading window, minimal resale price and the lockup checks. The token ownership is verified using the `token.b` table. The resale marketplace table is `resale.a`.

-   [resell - place tokens for sale on resell marketplace](./nft-actions/resell.md)
-   [token.b](./nft-tables.md#token-b)
-   [resale.b](./nft-tables.md#resale-a)

## Buying

An _Account_ can **buy** a token ownership.

A blockchain _Account_ can **buy** a token from the resale marketplace. This action is a subject to the trading window checks. The global and the token factory specific resale shares as well as the resale promoter are dealt with when the paid funds are transferred from the buer to the seller. The token is deduced from the _Seller_'s `token.b` and added to the _Buyer_'s `token.b`. The `factory.b` and `resale.a` are read to obtain the tradeable window, promoter and the shares info.

-   [buy - purchase token on resale marketplace](./nft-actions/buy.md)
-   [factory.b](./nft-tables.md#factory-b)
-   [token.b](./nft-tables.md#token-b)
-   [resale.a](./nft-tables.md#resale-a)

## Cancelling resell

The token _Owner_ can **cancelresell** tokens.

This action is only removes the token from the resale marketplace. The resale marketplace table is `resale.a`.

-   [cancelresell - cancel token resell](./nft-actions/cancelresell.md)
-   [resale.a](./nft-tables.md#resale-a)

## Burning

The token _Owner_ can **burn** tokens.

An NFT _Owner_ can execute the **burn** action which removes the token from the resale marketplace (`resale.a`), removes the token from the _Owner_ account (`token.b`) and updates the token factory `existing_tokens_no` field (`factory.b`).

-   [burn - erase tokens from owners and uniq factories](./nft-actions/burn.md)
-   [factory.b](./nft-tables.md#factory-b)
-   [token.b](./nft-tables.md#token-b)
-   [resale.a](./nft-tables.md#resale-a)

## NFT Service Use Cases

## Recalling

The _Asset Manager_ can **recall** tokens from an _Account_ in case of fraudulent action or erroneous issue.

During the recall time window the _Asset Manager_ can recall tokens from an _Account_ in case of fraudulent action or erroneous issue or other cases that require tokens ownership be returned to the _Asset Manager_. If the token being recalled has entered the resell marketplace, the reselling of such token is canceled. The **recall** action affects `factory.b`, `resale.a` and `token.b` tables.

-   [recall - cancel resell, return tokens to factory manager](./nft-actions/recall.md)
-   [factory.b](./nft-tables.md#factory-b)
-   [token.b](./nft-tables.md#token-b)
-   [resale.a](./nft-tables.md#resale-a)

## Authorizing Another Minter

The _Asset Manager_ or an _Authorized Minter_ can authorize another _Minter_ to issue tokens with a token factory with the **authminter** action.

Initially the _Asset Manager_ can delegate their ability to issue NFTs to some other account _Authorized Minter_ limited to issue up to the quantity of tokens. An _Authorized Minter_ can re-delegate a part of their quantity to another _Authorized Minter_. The `factory.a` table is read and `authmintr.a` table is modified during this action.

-   [authmint.b - authorize an account to be able to mint tokens](./nft-actions/authmint.b.md)
-   [factory.b](./nft-tables.md#factory-b)
-   [authmintr.a](./nft-tables.md#authmintrs-a)

## Controlling Token Factory Lifecycle

The _Asset Manager_ can stop issuing with or decommission a token factory.

The **setstatus** action lets the _Asset Manager_ to control the lifecycle of the token factory. Only the `factory.b` table is involved.

-   [setstatus - set token factory state](./nft-actions/setstatus.md)
-   [factory.b](./nft-tables.md#factory-b)

## Updating the Token Factory Metadata

The _Asset Manager_ can update the token factory metadata.

The **setmeta.b** action lets the _Asset Manager_ to set the token factory metadata updating the `factory.b` table.

-   [setmeta.b - set token factory metadata uri and hash](./nft-actions/setmeta.b.md)
-   [factory.b](./nft-tables.md#factory-b)

## Setting the conditionless receivers

The _Asset Manager_ can set the token factory conditionless receivers.

The **setconrecv** action allows the _Asset Manager_ to set the token factory conditional receivers - the accounts that can receive NFTs without checking for mintable window, lockup and other limitations. The action updates the `factory.b` table.

-   [setconrecv - set conditionless receivers](./nft-actions/setconrecv.md)
-   [factory.b](./nft-tables.md#factory-b)

## Adding factory purchase options

The _Asset Manager_ can add the factory first-hand purchase requirements

The **setprchsreq.a**/**setprchsreq.b** action allows the _Asset Manager_ to set a purchase requirement for the factory which can then be used by any user to purchase a token from the factory directly using **purchase.a** action.

**setprchsreq.a** action is deprecated, we recommend using **setprchsreq.b** action.

Multiple purchase requirements can be specified for a single factory. In addition to a simple fungible token price (UOS or USD) asset manager can specify the price for an individual purchase option using uniqs from other factories. Those uniqs can be either burnt or transferred to a specified account or simply verify their presence.

-   [setprchsreq.b - set purchase requirement](./nft-actions/setprchsreq.b.md)
-   [delprchsreq.a - delete purchase requirement](./nft-actions/delprchsreq.a.md)
-   [purchase.a - purchase a token](./nft-actions/purchase.a.md)
-   [fctrprchs.a - table of factory purchase options](./nft-tables.md#fctrprchs-a)

# acptfctofr.a

Accept the offer made on the Uniq factory.

## Technical Behavior

Note that `acptfctofr.a` is used to accept the offer made by `mkfctofr.a` only.

When the action is executed, the offer should not be expired and the Uniq should be valid (i.e., should have not been burned).

The offered price will be checked again to confirm that it should be no less than `minimum_resell_price` of the factory.

The Uniq will be transferred to the buyer, or the receiver if specified when the offer was made.

The amount of offered price will be split in the same manner as 2nd hand resale, and part of it will be transferred to the owner.

The promoter share, which was specified when `mkfctofr.a` action was called, was transferred to the promoter specified as `promoter_id` argument, or to the default promoter if it is set in `saleshrlmcfg` table.

Shares will be calculated and distributed based on the [2nd Hand Sale Policy](../../../general/antelope-ultra/2nd-hand-sale.md).

The offer will be removed from `fctoffer.a` table.

The Uniq ID will be removed from `buyoffer.a` table and if both `nft_ids` and `factory_ids` fields becomes empty, the buyer's record itself will be removed.

# addkeys.a

Add key pairs for Uniq factory

## Technical Behavior

The manager of an Uniq factory should be able to add one or more key pairs at the factory level at any time, which means key pairs at the factory level can change over time. When that happens, all Uniqs minted from that factory should be able to use all key pairs no matter when minted.

Key `name` has to be unique.

Key `type` is the data type of the value, and it has to be in the supported list from `keytypes` table.

`edit_rights` define which permission can edit the value including manager | owner | authorized editor | user group.

`editor` this is authorized editor mentioned above, and it required to have at least one account here.

`default_value` has to match the key `type`, like integer if it's `uint` or `int`. Also, if the type is an array, total element cannot exceed the limit from [`keytypes` action](./setktypes.md). In case of the `string` or `string[]`, total character cannot exceed the limit.

Factory RAM payment will be calculated based on the usage of `key_defs` which include some fixed RAM usage and usage which will determined by the key `type`. And the payment is non-refundable.

Uniq RAM payment for the new key will be calculated based on how many Uniq are already minted from factory. And this payment will be put into factory on-chain RAM vault, which will be refunded when Uniq is burn.

# authmint.b

Authorize an account to be able to mint tokens.

## Behavior

This action can be used to delegate minting power to other accounts.

## Technical Behavior

**Parameter validation**

The action requires authorization of authorizer which can be either the token_factory’s asset_manager or another authorized minter. The account being authorized - authorized_minter should exist. token_factory_id is required and must exist. quantity should be a non-zero value. The optional maximum_uos_payment specifies the maximum amount of UOS that the authorizer want to pay. memo value has a 256 byte limitation.

**On-the-fly migration**

After v1 is activated by activers action, token factory exists either in v0 factory table, factory.a, or v1 factory table, factory.b. If the token factory exists in factory.a, then the token factory is moved to factory.b.

**Main operations**

This action allows a factory asset manager to be able to authorize (delegate) minting of factory tokens to another account called authorized minter. The following rules apply for this action:

-   If max_mintable_tokens is specified in the token factory, the asset manager can authorize equal to or less than the totally available tokens, which is max_mintable_tokens - minted_tokens_no - sum of delegated tokens.

-   An asset manager cannot authorize themselves, an authorized minter cannot return tokens to the asset manager.

-   An authorized minter can authorize (re-delegate) yet another authorized minter from their available amount of tokens.

-   An authorized minter can mint their authorized quantity of tokens.

-   Authorized minter info is stored into the authmintrs.a table of eosio.nft.ft contract with the token factory ID scope.

**RAM usage/cost calculation and payment/refund**

-   RAM usage used to store authorized minter info is covered by `eosio.nftram` account. If the unused RAM of eosio.nftram is less than or equal to 200MB, the action can’t be executed.

-   The cost of a authorized minter entry is paid to `eosio.nftram` and it will be locked up in the authorized minter entry. The funds are released back to the orinigal payer after the authorized tokens are minted

        -   First, the cost in USD is (Authorized Minter RAM payment size) \* (RAM price), where

            -   Authorized Minter RAM payment size: **124 bytes**

            -   RAM price: **0.15 USD/KB**

        -   The cost is paid in UOS. The action gets `1 MINUTE` conversion rate in USD/UOS from `eosio.oracle` contract. and calculates the cost by
            (124B/1024B \* 0.15USD/KB) / (conversion rate) = `0.01816406` **USD**/(conversion rate)

-   When a manager (i.e., factory’s asset manager)/authorized minter add a new authorized minter

    -   RAM usage will be charged according to RAM pricing rules, and its payment is sent from the manager/authorized minter to eosio.nftram in UOS.

    -   The payment and RAM usage are accumulated and book-kept in the manager's RAM vault as a record in RAM vault table, ramvault.a. Update the existing authorized minter’s quota (i.e., the amount of tokens that an authorized minter can mint) doesn't cost anything.

    -   If maximum_uos_payment is specified, the amount of payment will be checked to confirm whether payment is no more than maximum_uos_payment.

-   When an authorized minter’s quota becomes zero (by minting their quota or by delegating their quota to another authorized minter)

    -   The authorized minter’s info is removed from authmintrs.a table.

    -   The factory’s manager will get the refund proportional to the amount of RAM released from the RAM vault, i.e.
        refund = (accumulated RAM payment) \* (released amount of RAM)/(accumulated amount of RAM usage).

**Notifications**

`require_recipient` is done for `authorizer`, `authorized_minter` and for  of a token under resell and for asset manager of the token factory.

# authminter

Authorize an account to be able to mint tokens.

::: warning
Deprecated. Use `authmint.b` instead
:::

## Behavior

This action allows a factory Asset Manager to be able to authorize (delegate) minting of factory tokens to another account called Authorized Minter (further - AuthMinter). The following rules apply for this action:

-   The Asset Manager can authorize less than the totally available tokens, Total = `max_mintable_tokens` - `minted_tokens_no` - `sum of delegated tokens`.
-   Asset Manager cannot authorize themselves, an AuthMinter cannot return tokens to the Asset Manager.
-   An AuthMinter can authorize (re-delegate) yet another AuthMinter from their available amount of tokens.
-   An AuthMinter can mint their authorized `quantity` of tokens.
-   The RAM cost of storing new authorized minter info is covered by the authorizer’s (i.e., Asset Manager’s or AuthMinter’s) RAM quota. Modifying existing authorized minter info doesn’t change RAM payer.

## Technical Behavior

**Parameter validation**

The action requires authorization of authorizer which can be either the token_factory::asset_manager or another authorized minter. The account being authorized - authorized_minter should exist. token_factory_id is required and must exist. quantity should be a positive value. memo value has a 256 byte limitation

**On-the-fly migration**

After v1 is activated by activers action, token factory exists either in v0 factory table, factory.a, or v1 factory table, factory.b.
If the token factory exists in factory.a, then the token factory is moved to factory.b.
In the following descriptions, token factory is either v0 or v1 data structures.

# bidauction.a

Bid on an Uniq auction

## Technical Behavior

The action checks that the auction exists in the `auction.a` table with the specified Uniq and verifies that the bid is placed between `start_date` and `expiry_date`.

`bidder` is not allowed to bid on the auctions where he is the `owner`.

`bid` must be at least `min_bid_increment_uos` UOS or `min_bid_increment_basis_point` basis points (units of 0.01%) higher than the previous bid. The values are defined in [`auctioncfg.a` table](../nft-tables.md#auctioncfg-a). This does not apply if the auction does not have any `bidder` which is true for a new auction without any bids.

`bidder` can bid on the auction where he is already the highest bidder.

UOS for the bid is transferred from the `bidder` account to the `eosio.nftauc` account and is released back to the original bidder if the new bid arrives.

`eosio.nftram` pays RAM usage.

A successful bid stores information about the `bidder`, `bid`, `receiver` and `promoter_id` and may increase the `expiry_date` of the auction by `auction_extension_step` if it happens within `auction_extension_threshold`. The values are defined in the `auctioncfg.a` table.

## Action Parameters

Action accepts a single argument `bid` of type `bid_auction_wrap_v0`. The properties of this type are provided below:

title: 'burn'
order: 5

# burn

This action can be used to burn a token, see more details in burn.

## Behavior

Used to burn a non-fungible token from one user. This requires the **token_id** of a minted token in order to successfully burn the token. As well as the permission of the user who owns the token.

## Technical Behavior

**Parameter validation**

Upon the usage of the burn action the action verifies that the parameters supplied in the action have values. This includes owner, token_ids, and memo. The memo specifically has a 256 byte limitation. The required authorization is the owner user. The token_ids vector is verified to not be empty.

**On-the-fly migration**

After v1 is activated by activers action, token exists either in v0 token table, token.a, or v1 token table, token.b.
If the token exists in token.a, then the token factory from which the token was minted exists in v0 factory table, factory.a, which, in this case, is moved to factory.b.
In the following descriptions, token factory and token are either v0 or v1 data structures.

**Main operations**

The token from the token table includes a token factory id and this is used to fetch the token factory data. The token factory must exist for a token to be burned. The token will not be able to be burned if the owner does not own this token. If the token is up for resale then the token is removed from the resale table. If the token is placed on an auction, the action will fail.

After this data is verified the token quantity in the token factory is subtracted and checked for underflow. The token is then erased from the owner. The owner ensures that the fractional parts are truncated and they go to `eosio.pool`.
`eosio.nftram` refunds the fee to each account.

## Action Parameters

Try to think of the action parameters as a **JSON Object** when reading this table. There will be a **JavaScript** example of the action below this table.

**Notifications**

`require_recipient` is done for `owner` account and for asset managers of corresponding uniq factories

### V0

                        memo: 'bye bye tokens',
                    },
                },

    }
);
```

# Behavior Changes

After v1 is activated, if the token has already been migrated to token.b table, the UOS locked up for the token will be refunded from eosio.nfram to the relevant parties. The refund split is as follows:

-   15% goes to the factory’s asset manager

-   70% goes to the token owner

-   the rest including the fractional part(about 15%) fee goes to eosio.pool

See more detail in RAM rules for NFTs

# Changes in tables to Read/Write

it will migrate factory.a to factory.b, before reading the factory.b object.

title: 'buy'
order: 6

---

# buy

Purchase a token from the resale marketplace.

This will allow the user to purchase a token from the resale marketplace where non-fungible tokens are sold. This requires the buyer’s permission and has an optional parameter that will allow the buyer to gift the token to another user. In the case the token isn't gifted, they should specify themselves as the receiver of the token. There is the optional parameter for a promoter to be tacked on to the sale of a token.

## Technical Behavior

**Parameter validation**

Upon the usage of the buy action, the action will verify that the parameters supplied in the action have values, such as buyer, receiver, token_id, max_price, promoter_id. The memo specifically has a 256-byte limitation. The required authorization is the buyer. The buyer will always need to specify who the receiver of a token is.

Currently max_price is not being used with v0.

**On-the-fly migration**

After v1 is activated by activers action, token exists either in v0 token table, token.a, or v1 token table, token.b.
If the token exists in token.a, then the token factory from which the token was minted exists in v0 factory table, factory.a, which, in this case, is moved to factory.b.
In the following descriptions, token factory and token should be read as v1 data structures.

**Main operations**

The function will look into the resale table and attempt to find a token that matches the token_id specified by the user during their buy action. The transaction will fail if the token is not found or the token is not for sale. This also prevents the buyer from buying their own resale tokens.

Once the token is found it will retrieve the token factory from the token factory table. This value can then be used to ensure that the trading window is valid for the token that is being bought.

If min_resell_price for a token factory is in USD the final price is calculated as max of resell_price and
min_resell_price converted to UOS using 1 min moving average. If max_price is less than final price
transaction is reverted.

If promoter_id is set, the account will be added to resale shares list and will have the payment distributed accordingly. If not promoter is specified then default promoter will be used specified by Ultra in `saleshrlmcfg` table under a scope of `1` in `default_promoter`.

Resale shares in the global resale table will be initialized if un-available.

Shares will be calculated and distributed based on the [2nd Hand Sale Policy](../../../general/antelope-ultra/2nd-hand-sale.md).

After the shares are distributed and no additional transfers need to occur the token will be emplaced into the receiver’s account and the original token owner will have the token erased from their account.

The resale table will have the token erased as well.

**Notifications**

`require_recipient` is done for `buyer`, `receiver`, `owner` of a token under resell and for asset manager of the token factory.

# cancelauct.a

Cancel an an Uniq auction without any bids

## Technical Behavior

The action checks that the auction exists in the `auction.a` table with the specified Uniq with ID `token_id`.

If the auction has reached its expiration date, the `canceler` can be any account, including the auction creator. Otherwise, only the auction creator can cancel an auction.

If the auction contains a bidder, the action will fail.

If all checks pass successfully, the auction will be erased from the `auction.a` table.

title: 'cancelresell'
order: 7

---

# cancelresell

This action can be used to cancel the resell of a token.

## Technical Behavior

After using **cancel resell action** the action will verify that the parameters supplied in the action have values. This includes **token_id and memo.**

The memo specifically has a 256 byte limitation. The required authorization is the **seller** as the seller is the one who is meant to own the token that is being sold. The token has its version looked up and then proceeds with the following resale behavior.

Once a version is determined and the **token** has determined its route for resale it will retrieve the **token** from the token table. It will validate that the **resale** entry existing meaning that the token is currently set up for sale.

Once the **resale** entry is found and authorization of the token owner is verified then this **resale** entry is erased and it is no longer possible to buy this token.

## Action Parameters

Try to think of the action parameters as a **JSON Object** when reading this table. There will be a **JavaScript** example of the action below this table.

# clrmintst

Clears (i.e., deletes the rows of) minting status table of a token factory.

## Behavior

Allow an asset owner to clear the minting status table.

## Technical Behavior

**Parameter validation**

token_factory_id is the token factory ID that should exist. memo string to accompany the transaction should be no more than 256 bytes. The required authorization is the token_factory::asset_manager.

**On-the-fly migration**

After v1 is activated by activers action, token factory exists either in v0 factory table, factory.a, or v1 factory table, factory.b.
If the token factory exists in factory.a, then the token factory is moved to factory.b.
In the following descriptions, token factory is either v0 or v1 data structures.

**Main operations**

The action deletes the specified no_of_entries from the token_factory’s mintstat (mintstat.a) table. If all rows are deleted, the table itself is deleted as well. If no_of_entries is not specified (i.e., null), all entries are deleted.

title: 'create.b'
order: 10

# create.b

Create a token factory.

## Behavior

Used to create a token factory for the asset_creator and will be managed by the asset_manager.

The asset_manager and the asset_creator need to agree on the token factory configuration according to their specific business strategy, like resale share, etc. The agreement is done via the co-signing of the transaction.

By creating the token factory together, the asset_creator agrees to all the terms, including letting the asset_manager manage the factory and its tokens.

If the stat parameter is not specified, a new token factory is created in inactive state which may be changed with the setstatus action.

RAM usage of a factory creation is covered by eosio.nftram.

If asset_manager is other than ultra.nft.ft, the cost of a factory creation is paid in UOS to eosio.pool.

## Technical Behavior

Upon creation, a token factory id will be automatically assigned to the new token factory. This id is incremental.

**Token factory ID**

-   64-bit number

-   Factory counter is stored in a singleton table, which will be automatically increased each time a token factory is created.

**Factory creation**

-   RAM usage of a factory creation is covered by eosio.nftram. 4GB will be gifted to eosio.nfrram to start with. The action fails If the unused RAM of eosio.nftram is less than or equal to 200MB.

-   factory data is stored to factory.b table. Each factory.b entry’s pack size should be less than or equal to 1920 bytes.

-   if asset_manager is other than ultra.nft.ft, The cost of a factory creation is paid to eosio.pool and it is non-refundable.

    -   First, the cost in USD is (factory RAM payment size) \* (RAM price), where

        -   factory RAM payment size: 2KB

        -   RAM price: 0.15USD/KB

    -   The cost is paid in UOS. The action gets 1 MINUTE conversion rate in USD/UOS from eosio.oracle contract. and calculates the cost by
        (2KB \* 0.15USD/KB) / (conversion rate) = 0.3USD/(conversion rate)

**Authorized minters registration**

-   Authorized minters can be registered at the same time, by being specified as authorized_minters (an array of minter_authorization_info) parameter.

-   Registration cost is calculated and charged to asset_manager. For the details, see authorized minters info RAM usage/cost calculation and payment/refund.

Minting limit per account of a token factory
Minting limit can also be set at the same time, by being specified as account_minting_limit parameter.

**Notifications**

`require_recipient` is done for `asset_manager` and `asset_creator`

# create

Create a token factory.

::: warning
Deprecated. Use `create.b` instead
:::

## Behavior

Used to create a token factory for the **asset_creator** and will be managed by the **asset_manager**.

The **asset_manager** and the **asset_creator** need to agree on the token factory configuration according to their specific business strategy, like resale share, etc. The agreement is done via the co-signing of the transaction.

By creating the token factory together, the **asset_creator** agrees to all the terms, including letting the **asset_manager** manage the factory and its tokens.

If the `stat` parameter is not specified, a new token factory is created in inactive state which may be changed with the `setstatus` action.

## Technical Behavior

Upon creation, a token factory id will be automatically assigned to the new token factory. This id is incremental and includes information about the NFT version.

## Token factory ID

-   64 bit number
-   First 12 bit will be NFT version
-   Next 52 bit will be factory counter
-   Factory counter is singleton table with NFT version as entry, will auto increase each time a token factory is created

## Action Parameters

# createauct.a

Create an Uniq auction

## Technical Behavior

The action stores the auction to the `auction.a` table with the specified arguments. The new auction ID is read from the `next.nftauc` table, whose `value` field is then incremented.

`eosio.nftram` pays RAM usage.

Only one auction may exist per Uniq. The Uniq, which is placed on auction, must not be on a resell.

`starting_price` should be no less than `min_starting_price` of `auctioncfg.a` and also should be no less than `minimum_resell_price` of the factory.

`promoter_basis_point` should be in the range between `min_promoter_share_bp` and `max_promoter_share_bp` of `saleshrlmcfg` table configurations for resale (scope `1`). The default range is between 200 (2.0 %) and 1000 (10 %).

Time between `start_date` (or the time when the transaction is executed) and `expiry_date` must be within `trading_window_start` and `trading_window_end` of the factory. It must also be at least equal to `min_duration` and must not exceed `max_duration` stored in `auctioncfg.a`.

`duration` should be in the range between `min_duration` and `max_duration` of `offercfg.a`. If duration is longer than the trading window of the factory, it will be capped by `trading_window_end`.

# creategrp

Creates a factory group.

## Technical Behavior

* Anyone can create a factory group. RAM is charged in the beginning so a creator needs to make sure max_uos_payment is larger than charged value.

* `factories` field cannot contain duplicates.

**RAM usage/cost calculation and payment/refund**

-   RAM usage used to store factory group info is covered by `eosio.nftram` account. If the unused RAM of eosio.nftram is less than or equal to 200MB, the action can’t be executed.

-   The cost of a factory group entry is paid to `eosio.nftram` and it will be locked up in this entry. The funds are released back to the original payer after the factory group is deleted

      -   First, the cost in USD is (factory RAM payment size) \* (RAM price), where

          -   NFT RAM payment size: **960 bytes**. Estimated for:
              - `uri` with length of 256
              - 64 entries in `factories`

          -   RAM price: **0.15 USD/KB**

      -   The cost is paid in UOS. The action gets `1 MINUTE` conversion rate in USD/UOS from `eosio.oracle` contract. and calculates the cost by
          (960B/1024B \* 0.15USD/KB) / (conversion rate) = `0.140625` **USD**/(conversion rate)

-   When a factory group manager adds or removes a factory from the group

    -   No additional RAM is charged for or released funds for

## Action Parameters

# deletegrp

Deletes a factory group with specified id.

## Technical Behavior

ID should be valid and transaction signed by the manager of the corresponding group.

**RAM usage/cost calculation and payment/refund**

-   After deleting a token factory group, 85% of UOS locked in the factory group is released back to the original payer, while 15% goes to the `eosio.pool` account.

## Action Parameters

| field name | c++ type | js type |
| ---------- | -------- | ------- |
| id         | uint64_t | number  |

## CLI

```bash
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft deletegrp '[33]' -p ubisoft
```

## JS

```ts
await transact(
    [
        {
            account: 'eosio.nft.ft',
            name: 'deletegrp',
            authorization: [{ actor: 'ubisoft', permission: 'active' }],
            data: {
                id: 33,
            },

    }
);
```

title: 'delprchsreq.a'
order: 33

---

# delprchsreq.a

This action is used to delete purchase requirements for a token factory.

## Technical Behavior

Deletes an existing purchase option of the factory with specified `token_factory_id` and purchase option with specified `index`. Transaction should be signed by factories asset manager otherwise it will fail.

If the asset manager of the factory is an account other than `ultra.nft.ft`, 85% of the locked-up UOS payment (`uos_payment`) is refunded to the factory's asset manager. Ultra always takes a 15% non-refundable commission and it goes to the `eosio.pool` system account. This is done to prevent network abuse associated with constant RAM pricing model of NFT contract.

---
title: 'issue.b'
order: 14

---

# issue.b

This action can be used to issue tokens by factory managers or authorized minters

## Technical Behavior

**Parameter validation**

Upon the usage of the **issue action,** the action verifies that the parameters supplied in the action have values, such as **to, token_configs**, and **memo.** The memo specifically has a 256-byte limitation. The required authorization is either the token factory manager or the authorized minter account for each token specified in **token_configs**. The **token_configs** vector is verified to not be empty and each **token_config** is verified to have an **amount** specified and a valid **token_factory_id** in order to begin the minting process of a token. The **token_metadata** vector is optional, but if provided, it is verified to be the same length as the number of tokens to mint. Providing the **token_metadata** parameter allows user to set the token metadata at the time of minting the token.

**On-the-fly migration**

If **token_factory** (**token_factory_v0**, to be exact) exists in v0 factory table, **factory.a**, the action copies it to v1 factory table, **factory.b** and removes the existing one from **factory.a**. After that, it operates on v1 **token_factory** (**token_factory_v1**, to be exact).

**Main operations**

The action retrieves the **token_factory** from the token factory table, **factory.b**. It validates that the **token_factory** is currently allowing tokens to be issued and checks if the token can currently be minted based on the **minting window** specified by the **token_factory.** It also checks if there is a **max_mintable_tokens** and ensure that additional token combined with existed token does not exceed that count.

When **max_mintable_tokens** amount of tokens has been minted, token factory will NOT transition to `inactive` or `shutdown` state automatically, this step needs to be done manually.

The token is then created and whoever the **to** user is the token is emplaced into their token list, **token.b**.

**Token ID**

-   Upon issue, each token will be assigned with 1 unique token ID

-   A singleton is used to track the global token ID.

**Minting Limit**

Minting limit is a new concept that was introduced in Release 27. It allows for uniq factories to limit the amount of tokens that can be minted to an individual account. Meaning, that if the **account_minting_limit** of a token factory is set to 5, then users may not purchase more than 5 tokens under that specific account.

-   **account_minting_limit** of a token factory can be set/reset by calling `limitmint` action. It is null by default, which means the minting limit function is not applied to the factory.

-   If a token factory has **account_minting_limit** specified, it automatically creates entries in the **mintstat.a** table with the scope of the **token_factory_id**, where the number of minted tokens for each issued account is recorded.

-   When the limit for the token factory is reached, it will prevent the user from purchasing any more tokens.

-   If the **account_minting_limit** is set to null it allows users to purchase infinite tokens.

**Authorized minter**

-   An optional parameter, **authorizer**, can be specified to issue tokens by an authorized minter instead of token factory manager (**asset_manager**).
    In this case:

    -   **authorizer**'s permission is required instead of token factory manager's one.

    -   **authorizer**'s minting quota stored in authorized minter info table is reduced by the number of minted tokens, and if it reaches zero, their authorized minter info record is removed from the table.

**RAM usage**

-   Creating new token

    -   RAM usage of creating a token is covered by `eosio.nftram`. **4GB** will be gifted to `eosio.nfrram` to start with. The action fails If the unused RAM of `eosio.nftram` is less than or equal to **200MB**.

    -   Token data is stored to `token.b` table and each entry’s pack size will be **192 bytes**.

    -   If the RAM usage for token exceeds maximum pack size of **384 bytes**, action will fail.

    -   If **asset_manager** or **authorizer** is other than `ultra.nft.ft`, The cost of creating a token is paid to `eosio.nftram` and it will be locked up in the token minted.

        -   First, the cost in USD is (factory RAM payment size) \* (RAM price), where

            -   NFT RAM payment size: **384 bytes**

                - estimated for a token with URI of size 192

            -   RAM price: **0.15 USD/KB**

        -   The cost is paid in UOS. The action gets `1 MINUTE` conversion rate in USD/UOS from `eosio.oracle` contract. and calculates the cost by
            (384B/1024B \* 0.15USD/KB) / (conversion rate) = `0.05625` **USD**/(conversion rate)

-   When a mintstats.a entry is added due to first time minting to an account from a factory with minting limit, it will charge the cost for adding each mintstat.a entry. The payer is the authorizer of the minting (it’s the authorized minter if using authorizer, ortherwise the manager). It pays to eosio.nftram, and its ram usage and payment will be bookkept in the manager’s vault.

-   When an authorized minter’s quota becomes zero (by minting their quota or by delegating their quota to another authorized minter)

    -   The authorized minter’s info is removed from `authmintrs.a` table.

    -   The factory’s manager will get the refund proportional to the amount of RAM released from the RAM vault, i.e.
        refund = (accumulated RAM payment) \* (released amount of RAM)/(accumulated amount of RAM usage).

**Notifications**

`require_recipient` is done for `asset_manager` of the token factory, `to` account that recieves the token and `authorizer` (if specified in the action)

# issue

This action can be used to issue tokens by factory managers or authorized minters

::: warning
Deprecated. Use `issue.b` instead
:::

## Technical Behavior

Upon the usage of the issue action, the action will verify that the parameters supplied in the action have values, such as to, token_configs, and memo. The memo specifically has a 256-byte limitation. The required authorization is the token_factory_manager user for each token specified in token_configs. The token_configs vector is verified to not be empty and each token_config is verified to have an amount specified and a valid token_factory_id in order to begin the minting process of a token.

It will retrieve the token_factory from the token factory table. It will validate that the token_factory is currently allowing tokens to be issued and will check if the token can currently be minted based on the minting window specified by the token_factory. It will also check if there is a max_mintable_tokens and ensure that additional token combined with existed token does not exceed that count.

When max_mintable_tokens amount of tokens has been minted token factory will NOT transition to inactive or shutdown state automatically, this step needs to be done manually.

The token_factory manager is required to authorize the minting of the tokens.

The token is then created and whoever the to user is the token is emplaced into their token list.

**Token Id**

Upon issue, each token will be assigned with 1 unique token id

A singleton is used to track the global token ID.

**Minting Limit**

Minting limit is a new concept that was introduced in Release 27. It allows for uniq factories to limit the amount of tokens that can be minted to an individual account. Meaning, that if the account_minting_limit of a token factory is set to 5. Then users may not purchase more than 5 Tokens under that specific account.

-   account_minting_limit of a token factory can be set/reset by calling limitmint action. It is null by default, which means minting limit function is not applied to the factory.

-   When a token factory has account_minting_limit specified it will automatically create entries in the mintstat.a table with the scope of the token_factory_id, where the number of minted tokens for each issued account is recorded.

-   When the limit for the token factory is reached it will prevent the user from purchasing any more tokens.

-   If the account_minting_limit is set to null it will automatically allow users to purchase infinite tokens.

-   An optional parameter, authorizer, can be specified to issue tokens by an authorized minter instead of token factory manager (asset_manager).
    In this case:

    -   authorizer's permission is required instead of token factory manager's one.

    -   authorizer's minting quota stored in authorized minter info table is reduced by the number of minted tokens, and if it reaches zero, their authorized minter info record is removed from the table.

-   ram used to mint NFTs is covered by eosio.nft.ft account, will also be changed to eosio.nftram account

**Redirect to issue.b (issue v1) action**

After v1 is activated by activers action, calls to issue action will be redirected to issue.b (issue v1) action .

title: 'lckfactory'
order: 16

# lckfactory

Allows a token manager to lock hashes for the factory, default token and all minted tokens as well as any token minted afterwards.

## Technical Behavior

The required authorization is the token_factory_manager as the manager is responsible for updating the data.

**token_factory_id** is required and must exist.

## RAM usage

-   Adding uri and hash will consume certain bytes depend on how many data are added.

    -   RAM usage is covered by eosio.nftram. But this action will fail if the unused RAM of eosio.nftram is less than or equal to 200MB.

    -   If the RAM usage is exceed token maximum pack size of 384 bytes, action will fail.

-   Updating or remove meta data which result in no bytes is added, there will be no restriction.

## Action Parameters

| Property Name    | C++ Type | Javascript Type | Example |
| ---------------- | -------- | --------------- | ------- |
| token_factory_id | uint64_t | number          | 1       |

## CLI - cleos

cleos push action eosio.nft.ft lckfactory '[1]' -p manager.acc@active

## JavaScript - eosjs

```js
await api.transact(
    {
        actions: [
            {
                account: 'eosio.nft.ft',
                name: 'lckfactory',
                authorization: [{ actor: 'manager.acc', permission: 'active' }],
                data: {
                    token_factory_id: 1,
                },
            },
        ],
    },

        expireSeconds: 30,
    }
);
```

---
title: 'limitmint'
order: 15

---

# limitmint

Sets/Resets the minting limit per account of a token factory

## Technical Behavior

-   limitmint action first verifies the parameters passed to it.

    - token_factory_id - the token factory ID

    - account_minting_limit - the number of minting limit per account, or 0 to invalidate the setting. If not 0 and token factory has a valid max_mintable_tokens (i.e., not null), account_minting_limit should be no more than max_mintable_tokens.

    - memo - the memo string to accompany the transaction, should be no more than 256 bytes

    - The action should be called with the token factory manager(asset_manager)’s permission.

- The action stores account_minting_limit parameter value to the token factory’s account_minting_limit field. If account_minting_limit of 0 is specified, the action resets the token factory’s account_minting_limit field to null.

- Each time when issue action is called, if the token factory has a valid account_minting_limit, minted number of tokens is recorded for each of the token receiver's account in mintstat (mintstat.a) table. If the number of minted tokens has been already reached  account_minting_limit , issue action prevents the receiver from getting any more tokens.

## RAM Usage

Setting account_minting_limit will consume 4 bytes of RAM

RAM usage is covered by eosio.nftram. But this action will fail if the unused RAM of eosio.nftram is less than or equal to 200MB.

If the RAM usage is exceed factory maximum pack size of 1920 bytes, action will fail.

When update or reset account_minting_limit, there is no restriction on RAM usage.

## Action Parameters

| Name                  | C++ Type  | Javascript Type  |
| --------------------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| token_factory_id      | unint64_t | number or string |
| account_minting_limit | uint32_t  | number or string |
| memo                  | string    | string           |

## CLI - Cleos

```
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft limitmint '{"token_factory_id": 5, "account_minting_limit": 100, "memo": "limitmint time"}' -p factory.manager@active
```

## JavaScript - eosjs

```javascript
await api.transact(
    {
        actions: [
            {
                account: 'eosio.nft.ft',

# mgrfactories

This action can be used to migrate uniq factories from v0 to v1 as continuous migration.

## Parameter validation

The number of factories to migrate is specified as total_no, which should not be zero.

## Main operations

Each v0 factory record in factory.a table is converted to v1 factory record and moved to factory.b table. This process continues for total_no times or until factory.a table becomes empty, in which case factory_a_migration_done flag (1) is set in migration table.

## Action Parameters

| Property Name | C++ Type | JavaScript Type |
| ------------- | -------- | --------------- |
| total_no      | uint64_t | number          |

## CLI - cleos

```bash
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft mgrfactories '{"total_no": 10}' -p ultra.nft.ft@active
```

## JavaScript - eosjs

```javascript
await api.transact(
    {
        actions: [
            {
                account: 'eosio.nft.ft',

title: 'Migration Behavior'
order: -99

# Migration Behavior

The NFT smart contract is written in a way to allow for **migration from our existing NFT version to our new version automatically**. The end user of the action does not have to do anything new, but it is **highly recommended to migrate** to the new action pattern as soon as possible.

This is done by having a parent function that handles migration on the fly. This means that when the action is called in the future for a specific smart contract that has not migrated from a previous version to the new version, it will re-route the action through the appropriate version after making the necessary table changes to support the new version.

These migration behaviors are done across the entire smart contract and exist in almost every action.

## Example Behavior

We will take the `create` action as an example of this behavior.

We will be doing a migration from V0 to V1 to help describe the general behavior.

Once migration has started inside of the smart contract a flag is enabled and will begin taking any of the existing `create` structs that are sent through the main function and automatically converting them.

This is done by taking the `V0` struct and automatically creating a new `V1` struct. New values are created, defined, and even in some cases transformed to support the new tables.

After performing the struct migration, it will reroute the action into the correct version of the function that can handle the new `struct` data.

## Conclusion

Each action has their own migration pattern and they are all complex in their own unique way.

When a new version is announced it is always best to migrate your actions to match the structs which are provided.

title: 'mkfctofr.a'
order: 40

---

# mkfctofr.a

Make an offer on a Uniq factory.

## Technical Behavior

The offer should be done at the time which is in the range of trading window of the factory.

The action stores the offer to `fctoffer.a` table with the specified arguments. The new offer ID is read from `next.fctofr` table whose `value` field is then incremented.

`eosio.nftram` pays RAM usage.

The offered price will be transferred to `eosio.nftofr` account and will be kept until the offer is either accepted or cancelled.

An account will not be able to make offers on the same factories that they already made.

An account will not be able to make offers if their total offers (including Uniq and Uniq factory) is more than `max_active_offer_per_user` of `offercfg.a`, which records the global configurations.

`price` should be no less than `min_price` of `offercfg.a` and also should be no less than `minimum_resell_price` of the factory.

`promoter_basis_point` should be in the range between `min_promoter_share_bp` and `max_promoter_share_bp` of `saleshrlmcfg` table configurations for resale. If `saleshrlmcfg` table doesn’t exist, the default range is between 250 (2.5 %) and 1000 (10 %).

`duration` should be in the range between `min_duration` and `max_duration` of `offercfg.a`. If `duration` is longer than the trading window of the factory, it will be capped by `trading_window_end`.

# mknftofr.a

Make an offer on a Uniq.

## Technical Behavior

The offer should be done at the time which is in the range of trading window of the Uniq factory from which the Uniq was issued.

The action stores the offer to `nftoffer.a` table with the specified arguments. The new offer ID is read from `next.nftofr` table whose `value` field is then incremented.

`eosio.nftram` pays RAM usage.

The offered price will be transferred to `eosio.nftofr` account and will be kept until the offer is either accepted or cancelled.

An account will not be able to make offers on the same Uniq that they already made.

An account will not be able to make offers if their total offers (including Uniq and Uniq factory) is more than `max_active_offer_per_user` of `offercfg.a`, which records the global configurations.

`owner` should be neither buyer nor receiver.

`price` should be no less than `min_price` of `offercfg.a` and also should be no less than `minimum_resell_price` of the factory.

`promoter_basis_point` should be in the range between `min_promoter_share_bp` and `max_promoter_share_bp` of `saleshrlmcfg` table configurations for resale. If `saleshrlmcfg` table doesn’t exist, the default range is between 250 (2.5 %) and 1000 (10 %).

`duration` should be in the range between `min_duration` and `max_duration` of `offercfg.a`. If duration is longer than the trading window of the factory, it will be capped by `trading_window_end`.

title: 'purchase.a'

# purchase.a

This action is used to purchase uniqs directly from a token factory.

## Technical Behavior

1. User provides information about the Uniq they wish to purchase

2. Verify that the Uniq has a purchase requirement

3. Obtain the price of the Uniq and convert to UOS

4. Verify that if the purchase requirement requires additional uniqs that the uniqs passed are relevant to the purchase requirement

5. Additional transfer, and burning actions may be used on individual uniqs during the verification process. They are kept if the transaction fails

6. Distribute shares based on purchase requirements, done through inline calls

7. Send protocol fee. Amount and account are configured under `global.share` table scope `0`, done through inline calls

8. Send remainder of shares to the factory manager, done through inline calls

9. Issue the token to the user. **Note**: minting a Uniq requires additional UOS paid by the factory manager. Refer for details to [issue.b - issue tokens with token factory](./issue.b.md)

10. Increment the number of tokens purchased for the given user

11. If a purchase option has been configured with `group_restriction` via the `setprchsreq.a` action, the `purchase.a` action will take these restrictions into account before allowing the purchase to proceed.

> **Note**: For details on how to configure `group_restriction` through `setprchsreq.a`, please refer to [setprchsreq.a](./setprchsreq.a.md).

If promoter_id is set, the account will be added to resale shares list and will have the payment distributed accordingly. If no promoter is specified then default promoter will be used and is specified by Ultra in `saleshrlmcfg` table under a scope of `0` in `default_promoter`.

### Supplying Uniqs for Purchases

In some cases a token factory may require certain uniqs to exist in the user inventory table to enable the user to purchase a uniq.

Think of it like a pre-requisite or an entry ticket to purchasing other uniqs.

When a uniq is being purchased it goes through our `verify_user_uniqs` function that looks into the buyer's inventory and verifies that the uniq factories required uniqs matches the user supplied uniqs. The function checks that the `user supplied uniqs` from the user matches the `factory required uniqs`. The function checks that the user is passing uniqs that have the correct token factory id, and checks that the user **is not** passing irrelavant uniqs.

It also ensures that the strategy that is being passed for each uniq matches the strategy used by the factory for the specific token factory id.

Strategy meaning: `0` just check ownership of the provided nft, `1` burn the uniq and `2` transferring the uniq out of the user inventory.

All of these strategies, and individual uniqs can be chosen by the user to ensure they are removing the uniq they want to remove, rather than risking a more 'rare' uniq that they want to keep.

### Burning Uniqs on Purchase

During the purchase if a uniq has a strategy of `1` it will automatically perform an inline call to the `burn` action and pass over any tokens that need to be burned.

Internally we are constructing a vector of which `token_ids` to be burned.

### Transferring Uniqs on Purchase

During the purchase if a uniq has a strategy of `2` it will automatically perform an inline call to the `transfer` action and pass over any tokens that need to be transferred.

The transferred uniqs will automatically be moved to the `transfer_tokens_receiver_account` that was setup during the purchase requirements setup.

Internally we are constructing a vector of which `token_ids` to be transferred.

title: 'recall'
order: 19

# recall

The token factory manager can use it to recall a token.

::: warning
This action is deprecated.
:::

## Technical Behavior

Upon the usage of the **recall action** the action will verify that the parameters supplied in the action have values. This includes **owner, token_ids.** The memo specifically has a 256 byte limitation. The required authorization is the **token factory manager** of the **token_ids** specified. This can be done entirely without the token owner’s permission.

After doing the initial value checks the NFT contract version is determined and routes the recall function depending on what version the NFT token is.

Each token that is specified inside of **token_ids** will verify the following:

-   The **owner** actually owns the **token_id**.
-   The **token_id** has an entry in the table and a corresponding **token_factory.**
-   The authorization of the **token_factory manager** was given.
-   It will check if a recall window is specified.

    -   It will fail the transaction if no recall window exists for the token.
    -   At least a start or end time for recall windows must be specified for this action to work.

-   It will check if the **token** is past the recall window.

    -   Adds recall window time to the mint time of the token.
    -   Adds recall window end time to the mint time of the token.
    -   If the first bullet exceeds the end time then it cannot be recalled and the transaction will fail.

After checking the above, it will remove any entries in the resale table if available. Then the manager will have the **token** assigned to them.

The **owner** will have the token removed from their table.

_\*This business decision was decided upon to prevent credit card fraud and revoke tokens during a grace period for token sales. After the grace period is exceeded the token cannot be recalled._

## On-the-fly migration

After v1 is activated by activers action, if token exists in v0 token table, token.a, it is moved to v1 token table, token.b. Also, if the token factory from which the token was minted exists in v0 factory table, factory.a, it is moved to factory.b.

When done, v0 entry will be deleted so next time when interact with these data, no migration is needed.

# resell

Place tokens for sale on the resell marketplace.

## Behavior

Allows a user to set their token for resale and to specify the expected price. Think of it like marking a token for sale in a marketplace.

## Technical Behavior

Upon the usage of the **resell action** the action will verify that the parameters supplied in the action have values. This includes **seller, token_id, price, promoter_basis_point, and memo.**

The memo specifically has a 256 byte limitation. The required authorization is the **seller** as the seller is the one who is meant to own the token that is being sold. During this process there must be a price, and the **promoter_basis_point** has a minimum value specified by Ultra in `saleshrlmcfg` table under a scope of `1` in `min_promoter_share_bp` (default is **200** meaning **2%**) which serves as a share of the potential promoter of the future purchase of the token being sold. Otherwise it cannot exceed the maximum resale_share_limit value for the promoter. The maximum value is specified by Ultra in `saleshrlmcfg` table under a scope of `1` in `max_promoter_share_bp` (default is **1000 (10%)**). This means that that **promoter_basis_point** should by default be between **250 - 1000.** The token has its version looked up and then proceeds with the following resale behavior.

Once a version is determined and the **token** has determined its route for resale it will retrieve the **token** from the token table. It will validate that the **token_factory** exists by using the **token_factory_id** specified inside of the token. It will fail if it cannot determine these values.

During the resale verification it will determine if the price specified by the user is greater than the minimum specified by the **token_factory**. It will also check to ensure that the token can be traded and is valid for the trading window.

It will also ensure that the token has exceeded the lockup time specified by the **token_factory**. Meaning that at this stage it is fully available for being resold or traded.

Once this has been completed it will ensure that the **sale_shares** does not exceed the maximum **sales_share** percentage which is 10000 basis points (100%) and normally this should always be the case.

The action will try to find the token and ensure it doesn’t already exist in the token resale or auction tables.

If it doesn’t exist it gets placed on resell and the transaction is completed.

**Notifications**

`require_recipient` is done for `seller` and asset manager of the token factory

# setdflttkn

Allows a token manager to set metadata uri and hash for default token of an existing token factory.

Refer to [uniq-default-metadata](../../../../tutorials/uniq-factories/uniq-variants/uniq-default-metadata.md) for explanation on possible uses for default token metadata

## Technical Behavior

The required authorization is the token_factory_manager as the manager is responsible for updating the data.

-   token_factory_id is required and must exist.

-   memo value has a 256 byte limitation

-   uri is required to have non-zero length

If factory has `lock_hash` set to `true`:

-   Can change the `uri`, but `hash` must remain unchanged.

-   Cannot switch between `static` and `dynamic` default token URI (more details [here](../../../../tutorials/uniq-factories/uniq-variants/uniq-default-metadata.md))

## RAM usage

-   Adding uri and hash will consume certain bytes depend on how many data are added.

    -   RAM usage is covered by eosio.nftram. But this action will fail if the unused RAM of eosio.nftram is less than or equal to 200MB.

    -   If the RAM usage is exceed factory maximum pack size of 1920 bytes, action will fail.

-   Updating or remove meta data which result in no bytes is added, there will be no restriction.

# setnftmgrflg

This action can be used to set token migration done flag.

## Technical Behavior

The action sets token_a_migration_done flag (2) in migration table.

Since there is no way to determine that token migration is finished, the flag has to be manually set. No one should be able to set the flag except ultra.

## Action Parameters

There is no action parameter for this action.

## CLI - cleos

```
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft setnftmgrflg '{}' -p ultra.nft.ft@active
```

## JavaScript - eosjs

# setprchsreq.a

This action is used to set purchase requirements for a token factory.

Tokens purchased will be issued to the receiver account using [issue.b](./issue.b.md) action. Factory manager pays for minting the token

::: warning
This action is currently disabled.
:::

::: warning
Be mindful of the price you set for purchasing uniqs. If the price is too low and there are no restrictions for users to purchase uniqs using this purchase option then it may be abused to purchase many uniqs very cheap and then burn them. Associated cost to mint a token is on token factory manager
:::

## Technical Behavior

The factory manager can specify purchase options for users. Note that currently they have to use the same action for both creation and modification of purchase requirements.

-   If **asset_manager** is an account other than `ultra.nft.ft`, the cost of a factory creation is paid to `eosio.nftram` and it will be locked up in the purchase option.

    -   First, the cost in USD is (factory RAM payment size) \* (RAM price), where

        -   NFT RAM payment size: **2060 bytes**

            - estimated for `purchase_option_with_uniqs` and `group_restriction` of 64

        -   RAM price: **0.15 USD/KB**

    -   The cost is paid in UOS. The action uses `1 MINUTE` conversion rate in USD/UOS from `eosio.oracle` contract. Assuming UOS price of 1\$ the cost per purchase requirement is:
        > 2060B/1024B \* 0.15USD/KB ~ 0.3$ = 0.3 UOS

`token_factory_id` - token factory managed by a factory manager.

`index` - purchase requirements index. starts with 0.

`price` - price per uniq. Should be specified in either `UOS` or `USD`. Together with `purchase_option_with_uniqs` this is what a user provides to mint a uniq. If `price` is set to 0 then either `purchase_limit` should be set or `purchase_option_with_uniqs` should require some token to be burnt or transferred.

`purchase_limit` - how much users can buy via purchase action. It has to be less than factory limit setting and greater or equal to what was already minted via the action. If value provided is below the number of tokens already purchased from this option the `purchase_limit` will be set to be equal to the number of purchased tokens from this option

`promoter_basis_point` is used to specify how much % of a sale a promoter will get. Minimum value is `0` (0%), maximum value is `1000` (10%). Value range is controlled by `min_promoter_share_bp` and `max_promoter_share_bp` stored in `saleshrlimcfg` table under the scope of `0`.

`purchase_option_with_uniqs` - optional field used to set purchase options via uniqs. user has to have `count` tokens from listed uniq factories. They will be burned, transferred or checked as per `strategy` setting.

`sale_shares` is used to set royalties.

If RAM price is greater than `maximum_uos_payment` transaction reverts.

If token factory is inactive transaction reverts as well.

`group_restriction` is an optional parameter that accepts a vector of 64-bit integers. This vector is designed to apply logical restrictions based on the group IDs that users belong to. The structure of each 64-bit integer is as follows:

* The lower 60 bits represent the group ID.
* The upper 4 bits are reserved for logical operators.

Logical Operators
The logical operators are defined as bitwise flags in the following manner:

```scss
#define OR        0X1000'0000'0000'0000   // 0: AND, 1: OR
#define NEGATION  0X2000'0000'0000'0000   // 0: No negation, 1: Negation
```

* `4th Bit (OR Operator)`: If this bit is set, it indicates the OR operator. Otherwise, it defaults to the AND operator.
* `3rd Bit (NEGATION Operator)`: If this bit is set, it indicates that the NEGATION should be applied to the group ID.

The expression is evaluated from left to right, and parentheses are not used. Logical operators take into account starting from the second group ID in the sequence.

For example, a `group_restriction` vector like `<OR + NOT + group1, AND + group2>` would be evaluated as `(NOT group1 AND group2)`. This means the condition will pass if the user is not a member of `group1` AND is a member of `group2`.

Longer expression example for a `group_restriction` vector of `<OR + NOT + group1, AND + group2, OR + NOT + group3, OR + group4, AND + NOT + group5>`, the logical expression becomes:

```css
(NOT group1 AND group2) OR (NOT group3) OR (group4 AND NOT group5)
```

This means the condition will pass if:

* The user is not a member of `group1` AND is a member of `group2`, OR
* The user is not a member of `group3`, OR
* The user is a member of `group4` AND not a member of `group5`.


Formalization of Logical Expression Evaluation

To formalize the evaluation process, let's consider the `group_restriction` vector as `G = [g1, g2, g3, ..., gn]`, where each `gi` is a 64-bit integer that encodes both the logical operator and the group ID.

The corresponding logical expression `L` can be represented as:

```scss
L = O1(g1) OP2 O2(g2) OP3 O3(g3) ... OPn On(gn)

```

Where:

* `Oi(gi)` checks whether a user belongs to the group `gi` if there is no NEGATION bit, otherwise, it checks whether a user **does not** belong to the group `gi`.
* `OPi` is the logical operator (AND/OR) determined by the OR bit in `gi`, taking effect starting from `i=2` to `n`.

Notes:

* `Oi(gi)` will return either `group_i` or `NOT group_i` based on the presence of the NEGATION bit.
* `OPi` will return either `AND` or `OR` depending on the presence of the OR bit.
* While the expression `L` is evaluated from left to right, it also adheres to operator precedence rules: AND operations have higher precedence than OR operations, similar to standard Boolean logic. This means that all AND operations will be executed first, followed by the OR operations.

By understanding this formalization, you can ensure a clear and standardized way to construct and evaluate the logical expression `L` based on the `group_restriction` vector `G`.

`memo` - a string of no more than 256 characters. useful for parsing on a backend.

### Example Usage of the parameter ```"group_restriction"```

The logical operators' values are defined as
- **OR**: 0X1000'0000'0000'0000, or 1152921504606846976 in decimal.
- **NEGATION**: 0X2000'0000'0000'0000, or 2305843009213693952 in decimal.
- **AND**: 0, This is implicit. It can be ignored since it's 0.
- **NO NEGATION**: 0, This is also implicit. It can also be ignored since it's 0.

 Let's say we have two user groups
 - Group1_ID = 1
 - Group2_ID = 2

#### Use cases
1. no group requriement.
    - parameter value ``` "group_restriction": [] ```
2. users belong to Group1 and Group2 can purchase from this option
    - logical expression: Group1 & Group2
    - parameter calculation
        * = [Group1_ID, Group2_ID]
        * = [1,2]
    - parameter value:  ``` "group_restriction": [1, 2] ```
3. users belong to either Group1 or Group2 can purchase form this option
    - logical expression: Group1 | Group2
    - parameter calculation
        * = [Group1_ID, OR + Group2_ID]
        * = [1, 1152921504606846976 + 2]
        * = [1, 1152921504606846978]
    - parameter value  ``` "group_restriction": [1, 1152921504606846978] ```
4. users not belong to Group1 but belong to Group2 can purchase form this option
    - logical expression: ~Group1 & Group2
    - parameter calculation
        * = [NEGATION + Group1_ID, Group2_ID]
        * = [2305843009213693952 + 1, 2]
        * = [2305843009213693953, 2]
    - parameter value  ``` "group_restriction": [2305843009213693953, 2] ```
5. users not belong to Group1 or not Group2 can purchase form this option
    - logical expression: ~Group1 | ~Group2
    - parameter calculation:
        * = [NEGATION + Group1_ID, OR + NEGATION + Group2_ID]
        * = [2305843009213693952 + 1, 1152921504606846976 + 2305843009213693952 + 2]
        * = [2305843009213693953, 3458764513820540930]
    - parameter value  ``` "group_restriction": [2305843009213693953, 3458764513820540930] ```

# setprchsreq.b

This action is used to set purchase requirements for a token factory.

Tokens purchased will be issued to the receiver account using [issue.b](./issue.b.md) action. Factory manager pays for minting the token

::: warning
Be mindful of the price you set for purchasing uniqs. If the price is too low and there are no restrictions for users to purchase uniqs using this purchase option then it may be abused to purchase many uniqs very cheap and then burn them. Associated cost to mint a token is on token factory manager
:::

## Technical Behavior

The factory manager can specify purchase options for users. Note that currently they have to use the same action for both creation and modification of purchase requirements.

-   If **asset_manager** is an account other than `ultra.nft.ft`, the cost of a factory creation is paid to `eosio.nftram` and it will be locked up in the purchase option.

    -   First, the cost in USD is (factory RAM payment size) \* (RAM price), where

        -   NFT RAM payment size: **2060 bytes**

            - estimated for `purchase_option_with_uniqs` and `group_restriction` of 64

        -   RAM price: **0.15 USD/KB**

    -   The cost is paid in UOS. The action uses `1 MINUTE` conversion rate in USD/UOS from `eosio.oracle` contract. Assuming UOS price of 1\$ the cost per purchase requirement is:
        > 2060B/1024B \* 0.15USD/KB ~ 0.3$ = 0.3 UOS

`token_factory_id` - token factory managed by a factory manager.

`index` - purchase requirements index. starts with 0.

`price` - price per uniq. Should be specified in either `UOS` or `USD`. Together with `purchase_option_with_uniqs` this is what a user provides to mint a uniq. If `price` is set to 0 then either `purchase_limit` should be set or `purchase_option_with_uniqs` should require some token to be burnt or transferred.

`purchase_limit` - how much users can buy via purchase action. It has to be less than factory limit setting and greater or equal to what was already minted via the action. If value provided is below the number of tokens already purchased from this option the `purchase_limit` will be set to be equal to the number of purchased tokens from this option

`promoter_basis_point` is used to specify how much % of a sale a promoter will get. Minimum value is `0` (0%), maximum value is `1000` (10%). Value range is controlled by `min_promoter_share_bp` and `max_promoter_share_bp` stored in `saleshrlimcfg` table under the scope of `0`.

`purchase_option_with_uniqs` - optional field used to set purchase options via uniqs. user has to have `count` tokens from listed uniq factories. They will be burned, transferred or checked as per `strategy` setting.

`sale_shares` is used to set royalties.

If RAM price is greater than `maximum_uos_payment` transaction reverts.

If token factory is inactive transaction reverts as well.

`group_restriction` is an optional parameter that accepts a string representation of group ID restrictions, which is internally converted to a vector of 64-bit integers. This vector is designed to apply logical restrictions based on the group IDs that users belong to. The structure of each 64-bit integer is as follows:

* The lower 60 bits represent the group ID.
* The upper 4 bits are reserved for logical operators.

Logical Operators
The logical operators are defined as bitwise flags in the following manner:

```scss
#define OR        0X1000'0000'0000'0000   // 0: AND, 1: OR
#define NEGATION  0X2000'0000'0000'0000   // 0: No negation, 1: Negation
```

* `4th Bit (OR Operator)`: If this bit is set, it indicates the OR operator. Otherwise, it defaults to the AND operator.
* `3rd Bit (NEGATION Operator)`: If this bit is set, it indicates that the NEGATION should be applied to the group ID.

The expression is evaluated from left to right, and parentheses are not used. Logical operators take into account starting from the second group ID in the sequence.

For example, a `group_restriction` vector like `<OR + NOT + group1, AND + group2>` would be evaluated as `(NOT group1 AND group2)`. This means the condition will pass if the user is not a member of `group1` AND is a member of `group2`.

Longer expression example for a `group_restriction` vector of `<OR + NOT + group1, AND + group2, OR + NOT + group3, OR + group4, AND + NOT + group5>`, the logical expression becomes:

```css
(NOT group1 AND group2) OR (NOT group3) OR (group4 AND NOT group5)
```

This means the condition will pass if:

* The user is not a member of `group1` AND is a member of `group2`, OR
* The user is not a member of `group3`, OR
* The user is a member of `group4` AND not a member of `group5`.


Formalization of Logical Expression Evaluation

To formalize the evaluation process, let's consider the `group_restriction` vector as `G = [g1, g2, g3, ..., gn]`, where each `gi` is a 64-bit integer that encodes both the logical operator and the group ID.

The corresponding logical expression `L` can be represented as:

```scss
L = O1(g1) OP2 O2(g2) OP3 O3(g3) ... OPn On(gn)

```

Where:

* `Oi(gi)` checks whether a user belongs to the group `gi` if there is no NEGATION bit, otherwise, it checks whether a user **does not** belong to the group `gi`.
* `OPi` is the logical operator (AND/OR) determined by the OR bit in `gi`, taking effect starting from `i=2` to `n`.

Notes:

* `Oi(gi)` will return either `group_i` or `NOT group_i` based on the presence of the NEGATION bit.
* `OPi` will return either `AND` or `OR` depending on the presence of the OR bit.
* While the expression `L` is evaluated from left to right, it also adheres to operator precedence rules: AND operations have higher precedence than OR operations, similar to standard Boolean logic. This means that all AND operations will be executed first, followed by the OR operations.

By understanding this formalization, you can ensure a clear and standardized way to construct and evaluate the logical expression `L` based on the `group_restriction` vector `G`.

`memo` - a string of no more than 256 characters. useful for parsing on a backend.

### Example Usage of the parameter ```"group_restriction"```

```"group_restriction"``` consists of group ID strings concatenated by the logical operators specified by special characters as 

- **OR**: "|" (Vertical Line)
- **NEGATION**: "~" (Tilde)
- **AND**: "&" (Ampersand)

The internal logical operators' 64-bit values are defined as
- **OR**: 0X1000'0000'0000'0000, or 1152921504606846976 in decimal.
- **NEGATION**: 0X2000'0000'0000'0000, or 2305843009213693952 in decimal.
- **AND**: 0, This is implicit. It can be ignored since it's 0.
- **NO NEGATION**: 0, This is also implicit. It can also be ignored since it's 0.

 Let's say we have two user groups
 - Group1_ID = 1
 - Group2_ID = 2

#### Use cases
1. no group requriement.
    - parameter value ``` "group_restriction": ``` ""
2. users belong to Group1 and Group2 can purchase from this option
    - logical expression: Group1 & Group2
    - parameter value:  ``` "group_restriction": ``` "1&2"
    - internal 64-bit integers' vector representation 
        * = [Group1_ID, Group2_ID]
        * = [1,2]
3. users belong to either Group1 or Group2 can purchase form this option
    - logical expression: Group1 | Group2
    - parameter value  ``` "group_restriction": ``` "1|2"
    - internal 64-bit integers' vector representation 
        * = [Group1_ID, OR + Group2_ID]
        * = [1, 1152921504606846976 + 2]
        * = [1, 1152921504606846978]
4. users not belong to Group1 but belong to Group2 can purchase form this option
    - logical expression: ~Group1 & Group2
    - parameter value  ``` "group_restriction": ``` "~1&2"
    - internal 64-bit integers' vector representation 
        * = [NEGATION + Group1_ID, Group2_ID]
        * = [2305843009213693952 + 1, 2]
        * = [2305843009213693953, 2]
5. users not belong to Group1 or not Group2 can purchase form this option
    - logical expression: ~Group1 | ~Group2
    - parameter value  ``` "group_restriction": ``` "~1|~2"
    - internal 64-bit integers' vector representation 
        * = [NEGATION + Group1_ID, OR + NEGATION + Group2_ID]
        * = [2305843009213693952 + 1, 1152921504606846976 + 2305843009213693952 + 2]
        * = [2305843009213693953, 3458764513820540930]

## Integrating first-hand purchase into your own solution

We offer a sample project showcasing the utilization of first-hand purchase functionality. This enables users to exchange their Uniqs and/or UOS for other Uniqs. Feel free to clone, fork, or customize this solution according to your requirements.

# settfflag

Allow ultra.nft.ft account to open the NFT standard to let any account create and manage uniq factories

## Technical Behavior

The required authorization is the ultra.nft.ft account managed by admins.

After the transaction execution any account will be able to create factories using create.b action. Original v0 create action will still be ultra only, but will be deprecated anyway

## Action Parameters

N / A

## CLI - cleos

```
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft settfflag '[]' -p ultra.nft.ft
```

## JavaScript - eosjs

```javascript
await api.transact(
    {
        actions: [
            {
                account: 'eosio.nft.ft',

    }
);
```

title: 'settknmeta'
order: 26

---

# settknmeta

Allows a token manager to set metadata uri and hash for an existing token.

## Technical Behavior

The required authorization is the token factory manager as the manager is responsible for updating the data.

- `token_id` is required and must exist.

- `owner` is required and must own the token with id `token_id`

- `memo` value has a 256 byte limitation

- `uri` is required to have non-zero length or be null

If factory has `lock_hash` set to `true`:

- Can change the `uri`, but `hash` must remain unchanged. If the token does not have a `hash` then a hash can be changed regardless of `lock_hash` state.

**Notifications**

`require_recipient` is done for `owner` and `asset_manager` of the token factory

## RAM usage

-   Adding uri and hash will consume certain bytes depend on how many data are added.

    -   RAM usage is covered by eosio.nftram. But this action will fail if the unused RAM of eosio.nftram is less than or equal to 200MB.

    -   If the RAM usage is exceed token maximum pack size of 384 bytes, action will fail.

-   Updating or remove meta data which result in no bytes is added, there will be no restriction.

title: 'settleauct.a'
order: 46

---

# settleauct.a

Settle an expired Uniq auction

## Technical Behavior

The action checks that the auction exists in the `auction.a` table with the specified Uniq with ID `token_id` and verifies that the expiration date was reached.

`executer` can be any account, including the auction creator and the bidder. No additional payment is taken from the `exectuer` account.

If the auction does not contain any bidder, the action will fail. To remove an expired auction without any bids, the `cancelauct.a` action should be used instead.

If `promoter_id` was set by the highest bidder, the account will be added to the resale shares list and the payment will be distributed accordingly. If no promoter is specified, then the default promoter will be used specified by Ultra in `saleshrlmcfg` table under a scope of `1` in `default_promoter`.

Resale shares in the global resale table will be initialized if they are unavailable.

Shares will be calculated and distributed based on the [2nd Hand Sale Policy](../../../general/antelope-ultra/2nd-hand-sale.md).

After the shares are distributed and no additional transfers need to occur, the token will be emplaced into the receiver’s account configured during the bid, and the original token owner will have the token erased from their account.

The `auction.a` table will have the auction entry erased as well.

## Action Parameters

| Property Name | C++ Type | JavaScript Type | Description                                            |
| ------------- | -------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| token_id      | uint64_t | Number          | ID of the Uniq for which there is an auction to settle |
| executer      | name     | String          | Account that authorizes the transaction                |
| memo          | string   | String          | Memo                                                   |

# setvals.a

Set key values of an Uniq

## Technical Behavior

Before setting values, the key have to be defined in factory with [`addkeys.a` action](./addkeys.a.md)

Only editor including owner | manager | authorized editor can update Uniq's values if the edit right is configured for them.

The key value will only store in Uniq, and will be stored as key index and key value. Key index will be referred to factory key definition list.

In `key_values`, `key_name` must be unique and existed in factory keys. `key_value` must match the type defined in factory keys.

If no `editor` is included, owner will be the editor and the editor also need to sign the contract.

No RAM payment requires for this action since it's already paid in factory level.

# stauctcfg.a

Set global Uniq auction configuration

## Behavior

Set global configurations for all Uniq auctions.

## Technical Behavior

Only `ultra.nft.ft` account can set Uniq auction configurations.

The action stores the configurations to `auctioncfg.a` singleton table with the specified arguments.

All fields are optional, the action will only update the specified arguments and leave the rest the same as existing entry or as the default value if there’s no existing entry.

The action even accepts the same values as the ones currently stored in `auctioncfg.a`.

`eosio.nft.ft` pays RAM usage.

`min_starting_price` must be positive, and only supports UOS.

Both `min_duration` and `max_duration` must be positive, with `max_duration` must be greater than `min_duration`.

`min_bid_increment_basis_point` must not exceed 10000 (100%).

`min_bid_increment_uos` must be specified in UOS and have a positive amount.

`auction_extension_step` must be greater or equal to `auction_extension_threshold`. In case one of them is set to 0, the other one must be equal to 0 as well.

## Action Parameters

Action accepts a single argument `config` of type `set_auction_config_wrap_v0`. The properties of this type are provided below:

# transfer

Hand tokens over to another user.

## Behavior

Used to transfer a non-fungible token from one user to another. This requires the **token_id** of a minted token in order to successfully transfer a token from one user to another.

## Technical Behavior

Upon the usage of the **transfer action** the action will verify that the parameters supplied in the action have values. This includes **from, to, token_ids.** The memo specifically has a 256 byte limitation. The required authorization is the **from** user and will also check if the **to** account is an account that exists on the chain. The **token_ids** vector is verified to not be empty and each **token_id** is sent through a process where it retrieves the NFT contract version and routes the transfer depending on what version the NFT token is.

Once a version is determined and the **token id** has determined its route for transfer it will retrieve the **token** from the token table. The **token** from the token table will include a **token factory id** and this will be used to fetch the **token factory** data. The data retrieved from the **token factory** that is used to verify a handful of criteria which is dependent on the token creator’s specifications.

-   The token will not be able to be transferred if the **from** user does not own this token.

-   The token will not be able to be transferred if it is not available for trading.

-   The token will not be able to be transferred if there is a lockup period for the token and you’re within it.

-   The token will not be able to be transferred if the trading window has not begun, or has ended.

-   The token will not be able to be transferred while it is put up for resale or auction.

After this data is verified the token is erased from the **from** user and is given to the **to** user.

This process is **repeated for each token**.

**Notifications**

`require_recipient` is done for `from` account, `to` account and for asset managers of corresponding uniq factories

## Action Parameters

Try to think of the action parameters as a **JSON Object** when reading this table. There will be a **JavaScript** example of the action below this table.

# NFT Factory Groups

Factory groups allow token factory managers to assemble multiple owned factories into a single group.

This means that any game or items that belong to the same collection can be grouped together.

## Why?

Finding relevant data in the same collection on-chain can be difficult but this feature allows for a simple way to group a bunch of data together to represent a collection in the marketplace.

## How?

This is done by creating a table on-chain.

Each entry in the table represents a factory group.

A factory group has a metadata uri associated with it.

This metadata uri also has a hash to represent the data inside of it.

This also corresponds with the factories that belong to this group.

### `group_restriction` type

By default, regardless of which action version is used, `group_restriction` will be saved as vector of 64-bit integers. This might be hard to read since it includes logical expression with the value. For example: `2305843009213693953` means `NOT 1` or `~1`.

To be displayed as human-readable values, we recommend you implement some conversion on your side. Here is our small JavaScript example to convert 64-bit integer to readable string. You can run the included demo with `node user-group-converter.js`.

```js
// user-group-converter.js
const { isBigUint64Array } = require("util/types")

const OR_MASK       = 0x1000000000000000n   // 0: AND, 1: OR (= 1152921504606846976)
const NEGATION_MASK = 0x2000000000000000n   // 0: No Negation, 1: Negation (= 2305843009213693952)
const GROUP_ID_MASK = ~(OR_MASK + NEGATION_MASK)

/* RULES
- 1st element in group restriction array should not contain OR or AND
- Combination rules: [OR] + [NEGATION] + [group_id]
    + &[group_id]   = 0                     + 0                     + [group_id]
    + |[group_id]   = 1152921504606846976   + 0                     + [group_id]
    + ~[group_id]   = 0                     + 2305843009213693952   + [group_id]
    + |~[group_id]  = 1152921504606846976   + 2305843009213693952   + [group_id]
*/

const expression_to_string = (group, firstIndex = false) => {
    var result = ""
    
    // OR Extraction
    if (!firstIndex) {
        if ((group & OR_MASK) == OR_MASK)
            result += "|" // OR
        else
            result += "&" // AND
    }

    // NEGATION Extraction
    if ((group & NEGATION_MASK) == NEGATION_MASK)
        result += "~" // NOT

    // Group ID Extraction
    result += group & GROUP_ID_MASK
    
    return result;
}

const convert_group_restrictions = (groupRestrictions) => {

    var result = ""

    if (!isBigUint64Array(groupRestrictions) || groupRestrictions.length == 0)
        return result
    
    for (var i = 0; i < groupRestrictions.length; ++i) {
        result += expression_to_string(groupRestrictions[i], i == 0);
    }

    return result
}

const demo = () => {
    const groups = new BigUint64Array([2305843009213693953n, 2n, 3458764513820540931n]) // = "~1&2|~3"
    console.log(convert_group_restrictions(groups))

# How does oracle contract calculate UOS conversion rate

On-chain UOS conversion oracle contract is required to process conversion rates from multiple possible registered exchanges and needs to provide accurate information and on top of that needs to be resilient to gaps in data and potential deviation.

## Updating `feeddata` of associated exchange

When `pushrate` action is executed the oracle will update the `feeddata` table to add the new rate pushed by the exchange to the cache. Each exchange has a dedicated cache for rates which is later used for calculating the moving averages.

## Calculating moving average for `finalrates` table

When UTC minute changes (so 60 seconds have passed) the oracle will finalize the accumulated rates when the next `pushrate` occurs.

During the finalization process the oracle will perform outlier detection for the rates received from exchanges and will calculate the weighted average based on the 24 hours trading volume of each exchange. Calculated value in this way is considered a 1 minute moving average and is inserted into the `finalrates` table for level 1 (minutes) and will update the `rolling_moving_average` stored there.

Oracle utilizes median absolute deviation algorithm to detect and reject outliers from the available set of conversion rates from different exchanges.

Another finalization step occurs at the end of each UTC hour and day. The oracle will use the moving average stored in `rolling_moving_average` for level 1 (minutes) of `finalrates` table to update the level 2 (hours) of `finalrates` table each hour. And it will do a similar update between level 2 (hours) and level 3 (days) at the end of each day. In the process the rates and `rolling_moving_average` of the `finalrates` table will be update.

For each exchange oracle stores 2 sets of 60 seconds worth of conversion rates. After the finalization the `feeddata` table will be updated to delete the oldest set of rates (located at the bottom half of the 120 elements array).

## Updating moving averages stored in `finalaverage` table

During each finalization step done by the oracle (either for minutes, hours or days levels) the oracle will additionally update moving averages stored in `finalaverage` table at the associated level. This means that when level 1 of `finalrates` is updated the `finalaverage` table at the scope of `MINUTES` will also be updated. Similar for 2 - `HOURS` and 3 - `DAYS`.

## Handling gaps in data

In case there were no rates provided to the oracle contract the next time any rate appears from any of the exchanges the oracle will perform the calculations based on the available rates only. In case there is not enough rates to calculate the 1 minute average - it will be skipped. Similar thing is done for hours and days - in case there is a large gap in data the moving averages will be left unchanged.

You can utilize the timestamp to figure out how old the moving average is and whether you can consider it up-to-date or outdated. For more details see [this section](../../../tutorials/oracle/how-to-validate-and-refresh-moving-average.md#when-the-moving-average-can-be-considered-valid)

## Updating seconds moving averages on demand

To trigger the update it is necessary to manually execute the [`calcsecma`](./oracle-actions/calcsecma.md) action.

When the action is executed it will retrieve the most recent rates from the `feeddata` table for all exchanges, will perform outlier detection and will calculate the weighted average based on the 24 hours trading volume for each exchange. This step is done for multiple `feeddata` entries based on the window size of the moving average that is updated.

After the update the moving average stored at the `SECONDS` level of the `finalaverage` table will be updated.

# Oracle Contract

## Overview

`eosio.oracle` contract is responsible for processing conversion rates from USD to UOS, calculating moving averages for this conversion and storing it inside on-chain tables.

Oracle infrastructure is owned and managed by Ultra but anyone else can freely access the conversion rates stored in the tables to utilize in your own business logic.

## Contract features

- Supports multiple exchanges to process rates from
- Exchanges weighted based on the 24 hours trading volume
- Outlier detection removes likely anomalies from the conversion rates
- Supports variety of moving averages with windows ranging from couple seconds up to a couple of days
- Each conversion rate and moving average has an associated timestamp for validation purposes

## Tutorials

- [UOS conversion rate is calculation](./how-does-oracle-contract-calculate-uos-conversion-rate.md)
    - Read this guide to better understand how the USD to UOS conversion rate is calculated
- [Reading UOS conversion rate](../../../tutorials/oracle/how-to-get-uos-conversion-rate.md)
    - This tutorial covers how to access and read conversion rates and averages from the Oracle contract
- [Validating moving averages](../../../tutorials/oracle/how-to-validate-and-refresh-moving-average.md)
    - This page covers the validation and seconds level moving average refresh operation
- [Oracle contract tables](./oracle-tables.md)
    - If you already went through the tutorial to access conversion rates from the Oracle contract then you can also refer to this page for deeper understanding of the contract table structure

## Use Cases

Oracle contract is used or can be used in following scenarios

- Any contract logic that requires converting USD to UOS
- Any contract logic that requires the trend or average data for UOS price
- BP payouts for blocks produced
- NFT first-hand and second-hand pricing calculation that is done through USD and converted to UOS
- NFT RAM payment conversion from bytes to USD to UOS
- Ultra Pro Wallet creation price conversion from USD to UOS

# addma - add moving average

Registers new moving averages to the oracle contract.

## Technical Behavior

Moving average must be specified as a 4 digit precision asset with following symbol codes allowed:

- `SECONDS`
- `MINUTES`
- `HOURS`
- `DAYS`

Window size cannot exceed the table size configured during initialization.

If the fractional part of the moving average is 0 then it will be used to calculate the SMA with specified number of time units (e.g. 60 minutes SMA, 12 hours SMA, etc.)

If the fractional part of the moving average is not 0 then it will be considered as EMA, the fractional part will be used as alpha parameter of EMA (e.g. 12.5000 hours EMA is an EMA with alpha parameter of 0.5, the decimal part 12 is mostly ignored)

::: warning
EMA is currently not used and will likely be deprecated and removed

title: 'pushrate'
order: 5

# pushrate

Pushes a new USD to UOS exchange rate and latest 24 hours trading volume information to the oracle contract.

## Technical Behavior

Exchange used in the action must be one of the registered exchanges (see [regexchange](./regexchange.md)).

Timestamp for exchange rate must be at most 120 seconds older or 15 seconds ahead of the current chain time.

The action will update `feeddata` entry for the specified exchange writing the information about the new rate pushed. Will also update `oraclestate` to indicate the new latest rate timestamp and `lastknwnrate` singleton in case rate received is newer than the previous one.

In case the new rate has different UTC minute compared to the latest rate the finalization procedure will start which will calculate the SMA for 1 minute period using all the rates supplied in the last 60 seconds. All minute level averages defined in `finalaverage` table will also be updated. Similar procedure occurs when different UTC hour or UTC day starts.

# regexchange

Registers a new exchange in the oracle contract.

## Technical Behavior

Adds a new exchange to the `feeddata` table and initializes the cache to write conversion rates into during `pushrate`.

Will also update `oraclestate` singleton to have new total number of registered conversion rate sources.

Total number of registered exchanges is limited to a 100 to prevent accidentally causing overflow during oracle moving average calculations.

## Action Parameters

# RNG Contract

## Overview

`ultra.rng` contract provides a secure and verifiable random number generation service for Ultra blockchain applications. It uses BLS12-381 cryptographic signatures to ensure the randomness cannot be manipulated by any party, including the oracle.

For Ultra, the RNG service is deployed under account `ultra.rng` and provides a decentralized solution for generating random numbers that can be used in games, lotteries, and other applications requiring randomness.

## Contract features

### 1 - Request Random Numbers

-   Any smart contract can request a random number by calling the `requestrand` action with a unique seed and association ID.
-   The contract maintains a job queue and assigns unique job IDs to each request.
-   Seeds must be unique and cannot be zero to ensure proper randomness.

### 2 - Oracle Service Integration

-   The Ultra oracle service monitors the RNG contract for new random number requests.
-   When a request is detected, the oracle service generates a cryptographically secure random value.
-   The oracle service calls the `setrand` action with the generated random value and BLS12-381 signature.
-   The oracle service also manages the public key by calling `setpubkey` when needed.

### 3 - Verifiable Randomness

-   Uses BLS12-381 cryptographic signatures to ensure the randomness cannot be manipulated.
-   The oracle signs the random value with a private key, and the signature can be verified on-chain.
-   This prevents both the oracle and any other party from predicting or manipulating the random numbers.

### 4 - Callback System

-   When the oracle service calls `setrand`, the RNG contract verifies the signature and calls the `receiverand` action on the requesting contract.
-   The callback includes the association ID and the generated random number.
-   This allows contracts to receive random numbers asynchronously.

### 5 - Administrative Controls

-   The oracle service can set the public key used for signature verification via `setpubkey`.
-   DApps can be banned or unbanned from using the RNG service.
-   Jobs can be killed to clean up the job queue.
-   All administrative actions can be disabled through the contract manager.

### 6 - Security Features

-   Banned accounts are silently ignored when requesting random numbers.
-   Seeds are tracked to prevent reuse.
-   Job IDs are unique and incrementing.
-   All actions require proper authentication.

## Integration

To use the RNG contract in your smart contract:

1.  Implement a `receiverand` action that accepts `uint64_t assoc_id` and `uint64_t random_value` parameters.
2.  Call `requestrand` with a unique seed and association ID to request a random number.
3.  Handle the callback in your `receiverand` action to use the generated random number.

For a complete step-by-step tutorial on integrating the RNG contract into your smart contract, see [How to Integrate RNG in Smart Contracts](/tutorials/rng/how-to-integrate-rng-in-smart-contracts.md).

The RNG contract provides a secure, decentralized solution for random number generation that can be trusted for critical applications like gaming, lotteries, and other use cases requiring verifiable randomness.

# Ultra Accounts and Ultra Pro Wallets

## How it works

System contract provides 2 actions to generate new accounts of the following types: Ultra Account and Ultra Pro Wallet. Their names are automatically generated using a pattern `aa1aa2aa3aa4` and `1aa2aa3aa4aa` respectively. For more details see [this page](../../general/antelope-ultra/account-types.md).

Ultra sponsors the RAM needed for an Ultra Account and Ultra Pro Wallet creation.

## Ultra Account

Ultra Accounts (formerly known as Easy Blockchain Account or EBA) is a special type of account mainly for average users. It provides recovery options and is managed by our Backend.

## Ultra Pro Wallet

Ultra Pro Wallet (formerly known as non-EBA) is a typical blockchain account controlled by private keys you must secure yourself. In case you lose the keys - you lose the ownership of the account. This type of account allows full control and automation.

# System Contract Overview

The `eosio.system` contract inherits its functionality from the traditional EOSIO `eosio.system` contract. Below are Ultra’s additions or modification to it.

## Ultra Accounts and Ultra Pro Wallets

An Ultra account is a set of blockchain data records that establishes a permission graph for the account keys and keys belonging to other accounts. It controls the resources possessed by the account and provides a set of actions that are used to communicate with the account, and in the case that it is present, the smart contract.

[Ultra Accounts and Ultra Pro Wallets](./eba-non-eba-accounts.html)

## Know Your Client

Ultra requires that developers who wish to deploy smart contracts on Ultra platform perform a Know Your Client procedure.

[Know Your Client](./know-your-client.html)

## RAM Market

RAM is used for storing various on-chain data, like token, account, or smart contract data. Ultra requires that developers pay for the RAM consumed by their users. Only developer accounts are able to purchase larger amounts of RAM and then allocate it to their user base.

[RAM Market](./ram-market.html)

## Paying for 3rd Parties with Predicates

The predicate system allows developers to cover their users' resource costs. Developers may allow certain actions to be performed by other accounts at the cost of their own POWER resources.

[Predicate System](./predicate-system.html)

## POWER Staking

Account owners can stake POWER for their transactions to be included in blocks in a prioritized way. The traditional EOSIO stakes for CPU and NET separately while staking for POWER combines the two resources.

title: 'KYC - Know Your Client'

# Know Your Client

Ultra requires that developers who wish to deploy smart contracts on Ultra platform perform a Know Your Client procedure.

The purpose of the KYC requirement is to allow Ultra's end users to trust the smart contracts that they interact with. For Ultra this ensures that if there is an issue, we can contact the smart contract owner directly.

The KYB information ensures that there is no developer anonymity, which ensures that if there are bad actors actively taking advantage of either the network or its users, Ultra can step in.

## How it works

Ultra will let KYC providers to push their certificate on-chain. When a sensitive action is executed by a user (buying RAM might be one of such actions), the system checks if there is a KYC provider related to the user’s action.

## Relevant actions

All the KYC actions require Ultra authentication. They are listed here for general information only.

## registerkyc - register KYC information

# Power Bandwidth Staking

## How it works

A block producer includes the transactions into a block in a prioritized way so that the transactions from accounts which staked the most UOS for POWER bandwidth get into a block first. When all the transactions from the accounts that staked for POWER bandwidth get into a block, a BP starts including the “free” transactions from accounts that do not have staked POWER bandwidth.

The POWER bandwidth covers both CPU bandwidth and NET bandwidth which are employed in the process of transaction handling. Let us think that for processing a block of 3 transactions a block producer CPU requires spending 40 milliseconds, 20 ms for the first 2 transactions and 20 ms for the 3rd one. If the first 2 transactions belong to Account A and the 3rd one belongs to Account B, then accounts A and B should both have staked approximately same amount of UOS for the POWER at their accounts. The network bandwidth is handled alike: the account transactions size is proportional to the fraction of the POWER bandwidth that was staked to this account.

Both CPU and NET bandwidth usage for the accounts that submitted the transactions to the block are calculated and the distribution of the bandwidth usage per account should be approximately the same as the amounts of UOS staked for the POWER bandwidth per account.

# RAM Market

## How it works

Ultra maintains a **RAM reserve** from the available system RAM. The RAM in the reserve can be distributed by Ultra and can be offered to Ultra and certain developers for free. RAM may only be reserved by Ultra and once it is reserved it is removed from the total RAM supply. Reserved RAM is not assigned to anyone, nor it can be sold to anyone.

The initial 5k of RAM is free for the **account** creation which stores the basic account information such as the account name, active permission setup, and the additional RAM/POWER quota and usage which is around 3,871 bytes total. Developers pay for their users’ RAM usage, and they can authorize a contract to act on their behalf (32 bytes). They can also add one more keys to owner or active permissions (82 bytes). Beyond that account owners will need to buy more RAM themselves. One can’t purchase more RAM if they already have 10 MB or more of unused RAM.

Ram is priced in USD, but paid in UOS. There is a 10% ram fee which is charged at the moment of purchase. Users may **purchase RAM** at a flat rate. It’s expensive, so that users only buy when they truly need it, and they won’t need much. There will be a cap of around 20K which should be enough for most account administration needs. To calculate the RAM price Ultra uses a price curve that allows Ultra to adjust the starting price and control how fast price increase as a user owns more RAM. The current price curve is Price = C + K \* RAM. Price unit is converted from USD/KB to UOS/KB, C is used to control the starting price, K is used to control how fast it increases. Ultra can adjust the RAM price by changing the price/cost curve parameters, or even changing the curve type itself. It will only affect the RAM purchasing policy and won't affect the RAM selling policy.

The **selling RAM** policy is not changing. Total UOS paid will be stored and used for calculating refunds. When selling RAM, the total UOS paid will be proportionally refunded to the user:

```
Refund = Total_RAM_Payment * (Delta_RAM / RAM)
```

These differences between buying and selling RAM are introduces to avoid potential speculation due to price adjustment. If we use the same policy for buying and selling, it is possible for developers to make money by selling ram. With the independent selling policy, there is **no speculation**. Users always get proportional to what they have paid so far. Also, a developer cannot purchase more RAM until a full 10 MB of RAM are used up. Preventing developers from over-purchasing this scarce asset.

When a **developer purchases RAM** the system is queried for a price. There is an independent price curve for an account that is registered as a developer. The RAM pricing at the beginning of this curve is very cheap but gets more expensive as they purchase more RAM. When purchased in bytes, users needs to get an invoice first. When purchased with tokens or sold there’s also no need for an invoice. User can choose to purchase without getting a quote. In this case the purchase will use real time conversion rate. If a quote is generated before purchase then the user is guaranteed to get the RAM at the quoted price.

A developer can **refund** their **RAM** anytime and get back proportional to what they have paid. In case of account inactivity Ultra reserves the right to take back the unused RAM (only the portion of RAM that was gifted by Ultra) of inactive developer account, and refund in UOS will be returned to the account. An **inactive developer account** is one that submits no transactions (pushing or receiving actions) in a predefined period, like one year. Releasing user's RAM is a very sensitive process that requires due diligence. Even if the developer account is inactive, user might still want to keep their data stored there and query it from time to time. The conclusion is that used RAM can be released by the developer or DAPPs' users themselves, not by a third party. Malicious contracts’ data can be wiped out by BPs.

There can be multiple blockchain accounts associated with one ultra platform account, especially for developers. Such blockchain accounts are linked together on-chain by their IDs, and such accounts can purchase RAM and will be billed as if they are a single account.

# Token Contract

## Overview

`eosio.token` contract defines the tables and actions that allow users to create, issue and manage tokens on EOSIO based blockchains.

For Ultra, core token `UOS` are issued under account `eosio.token` using this contract.

## Contract features

### 1 - Create and Issue token

-   Only the contract owner, or the account owner where the contract is deployed, can create or issue tokens with this contract.
-   When creating a new token, you must define the maximum supply as well as the token symbol.
-   Once created, issuer can issue any amount to himself, however the amount of issued tokens cannot exceed maximum supply. Token balance will be opened for the issuer if it does not exist and `eosio.token` will pay for that RAM usage.

### 2 - Send and Receive token

-   Users can receive tokens from the account, if the user doesn't have token balance, it will be opened once transfer action from sender is successful. By default, `eosio.token` will pay the RAM usage for opening a new token balance.
-   To transfer, you will be required to have some tokens and a target account, not your account, which you want to transfer tokens to. Your transferred tokens need to not exceed the amount of tokens you currently hold.

### 3 - Retire token and close account balance

-   If you are a token issuer, you can retire any amount of tokens you already issued from your available supply.
-   For other users, once you open a token balance, you can close the balance as long as you have zero tokens in your account.

### 4 - System token UOS

-   UOS is the Ultra system token, it was created through the boot-up process during our network's genesis.
-   1 Billion Ultra UOS were issued at genesis to support swapping with ERC20 UOS and we will use inflation to pay Block Producers.
-   The UOS token is used to transfer value in the network, and as a way to gain access to required network resources like RAM or POWER.

# On-Chain User Groups in Ultra

This document describes the feature of on-chain user groups in Ultra. It serves as a guide for both users and developers to understand how this feature works and how it can be utilized in smart contracts.

Whether you are a developer looking to integrate this system into your application, or an end-user seeking to understand how to use the CLI or JavaScript SDK, this guide has got you covered. The documentation is divided into several key sections, each focusing on different aspects of the system.

### What Will You Learn?

- **Smart Contract Actions**: Understand how to create and manage groups through actions like `create.a`, `setmeta.a`, `adduser.a`, `rmuser.a`, and `clear.a`.
- **CLI Commands**: Get a hands-on guide on how to use `cleos` commands for performing various actions.
- **JavaScript SDK (eosjs)**: Learn how to make transactions using JavaScript via eosjs.
- **Table Descriptions**: Get acquainted with the blockchain tables like `groupid`, `groups.a`, and `users.a` that store state information for the group management system.

## Rules

### Group Creation

- Any account can create a group.
- The creator pays for the RAM usage.
- Optionally, a URI and hash for off-chain metadata can be specified during creation.

### Group Scope

- All groups reside in a global scope, not under the creator's scope.

### Group Information

For each group, the following information is stored on-chain:

- **ID**: Globally unique identifier that auto-increases.
- **Creator**: The EOSIO account that created the group.
- **User Number**: Number of users in the group.
- **Meta_URI**: URI for metadata (e.g., `https://ultra/group/meta/germany` or `IPFS://23LSDJFLSKJFL…`)
- **Meta_Hash**: Hash of the metadata.

#### Metadata Rules

1. Both `meta_uri` and `meta_hash` can have values.
2. Both can be empty.
3. `meta_uri` not empty, `meta_hash` is empty.
4. Cannot have an empty `meta_uri` while `meta_hash` is not empty.

### Group Updates

- Only the creator can update `meta_uri` and `meta_hash`.
- The creator pays for the additional RAM usage or receives a RAM refund.

### User Management

- Only the creator can add new users to or remove existing users from the group.
- The creator pays for RAM when adding users and receives a RAM refund when removing users.

## Use Cases

- Any smart contract can utilize groups for various functionalities.
- A user needs to belong to a group to mint tokens.
- Issue an NFT to a user if the user belongs to a specific group.
- Ownership rules can be group-dependent.

title: 'adduser'
order: 3

---

## `adduser.a`

The `adduser.a` action is the first version of the adduser action in the Ultra blockchain. This action allows the creator of a group to add one or more users to a specified group. The user account names will be added to the `users.a` table and the `nr_users` field in the `groups.a` table will be updated accordingly.

### Behavior

- The creator of the group can add new users to it.
- The `nr_users` field in `groups.a` table is incremented by the number of users added.
- The creator account pays the RAM usage to store the user entry in the users.a table.
- The action will fail if any of the user names have already been added to the group.

### Action Parameters

| Name       | C++ Type       | JavaScript Type   | Remarks                                                             |
| ---------- | -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `creator`  | `name`         | `String`          | The account that originally created the group.                      |
| `group_id` | `uint64_t`     | `Number/String`   | The ID used to identify the group to which the users will be added. |
| `users`    | `vector<name>` | `Array of String` | The user names to be added to the group.                            |
| `memo`     | `string`       | `String`          | A memo string.                                                      |

**Note**:
- The `creator` should be the original creator of the group specified by `group_id`.
- The `users` array should not be empty.

### CLI - cleos

To add users to a group, use the following `cleos` command:

```bash
cleos push action eosio.group adduser.a '{"creator": "alice", "group_id": 0, "users" : ["carol", "daniel"], "memo": "add two new users"}' -p alice@active
```

### JavaScript - eosjs

You can also use the following eosjs code snippet to add users to a group:

## `clear.a`

The `clear.a` action is the first version of the `clear` action in the Ultra blockchain. This action allows the creator of a group to remove all or a specified number of users from a group. The number of users removed is controlled by the `nr_removals` parameter.

### Behavior

- The creator of the group can remove all or a specified number of users from the group.
- The `nr_users` field in the `groups.a` table will be decremented by the number of users removed.
- The action will fail if there are no users in the group.

### Action Parameters

| Name          | C++ Type             | JavaScript Type | Remarks                                                                                                |

| `group_id`    | `uint64_t`           | `Number/String` | The ID used to identify the group to clear the users from.                                             |
| `nr_removals` | `optional<uint64_t>` | `Number/null`   | If not specified, all users will be removed. Otherwise, the number of users specified will be removed. |
| `memo`        | `string`             | `String`        | A memo string.                                                                                         |

**Note**:
- The `creator` should be the original creator of the group specified by `group_id`.

### CLI - cleos

To clear users from a group, use the following `cleos` command:

```bash
cleos push action eosio.group clear.a '{"creator": "alice", "group_id": 0, "nr_removals" : 1, "memo": "remove one user"}' -p alice@active
```

### JavaScript - eosjs

# 2nd Hand Sale

2nd hand sales include resell (in version a), auction (in a future version), and potentially other forms. Different parties can set up certain settings relevant to reselling a token in any form.

There is a global share for Ultra.

When a token factory allows NFT trading, the token factory manager can configure certain resale settings, e.g., minimum resale price, resale shares

An owner can also set up promoter share in the direct resell feature.

## How it works

### Global Share set by Ultra

-   Ultra can set up a global resale share that applies to any resale.

    -   By default it is 2%.
    -   It can be updated to any value between 0% to 10%, **which will be applied to all existing uniq factories and new uniq factories**.

### Resale Shares(beneficiaries) set by creator and manager

-   A token factory manager can set up the following information when creating a token factory.

| Resell Configs       | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| minimum resale price | All NFTs from this token factory must be listed at a price larger than or equal to this price for resale.                                                                                                                                             |
| resale shares        | resale shares in percentages for all beneficiaries set up by the creator and the manager. The sum of all resale shares must be between 0% and 70% ( configurable at factory creation, Ultra use Ultra.royal as Ultra’s beneficiary account at moment) |

The above information cannot be updated once the token factory is created, no matter whether it’s active or inactive.

### Promoter shares set by seller and buyers

-   The seller can specify the share for a promoter when reselling an NFT

| Resell Configs | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| promoter share | How much share for a promoter, it must be between 2% and 10%. If given value is less than 2%, it will use 2%. If given value is more than 10%, it will fail to list for resale. |

The buyer can specify the name of the promoter when buying an NFT. In Ultra marketplace, Ultra can set it to an Ultra’s account, but buyer could edit it with some effort.

### Overall 2nd hand Shares distribution in a buy event

-   Once an NFT is sold at X amount of UOS. The shares are as follows:

| Shares                                                                                     | Meaning                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| X \* Ultra global share percentage [0-10%]                                                 | The amount of UOS goes to Ultra.nft.ft account (configurable)                                                |
| X \* resale share percentages [0-70%]                                                      | Resale shares go to all beneficiaries                                                                        |
| X \* promoter share percentage [0-10%]                                                     | The promoter share goes to the promoter that is confrimed by the buyer. If no promoter, then this share is 0 |
| X \* (1 - global share percentage - sum of resale percentages - promoter share percentage) | After given shares to Ultra, token factory beneficiaries, promoter, the rest goes to the owner of the NFT    |

For example; Token A from token Factory F is on resell at the price of 100 UOS.

-   Ultra global share is 2%

-   Resale shares of token factory F are (dev1, 10%), (dev2,20%)

-   promoter share for token A is 5%

When a user buys token A specify the promoter opensea.

-   Ultra receives 2% \* 100 UOS = 2 UOS

-   dev1 receives 10% \* 100 UOS = 10 UOS

-   dev2 receives 20% \*100 UOS = 20 UOs

-   Promoter opensea receives 5% \* 100 UOS = 5 UOS

-   Seller A got 100 UOS - 2UOS - 10 UOS - 20 UOS - 5UOS = 62UOS

## Relevant actions

-   [create](../../contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/create.html): A token factory manager can configure the trading window when creating a token factory

-   [resell](../../contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/resell.html): An owner of the Uniq can use this action to resell the Uniq when allowed by the trading window

# Transaction Queues, Rate-limit, and Billing

## Failed Transactions in Antelope Blockchains

Antelope-based blockchains have historically faced challenges with failed transactions. These failed transactions aren't billed, but they still consume valuable CPU resources.

In summary:

1. A user pushes a transaction to an API nodeos.
2. API nodeos validates this transaction and forwards it via P2P.
3. The transaction reaches the block producer nodeos, gets executed, and is included in a block.

However, many transactions sent to API nodeos and block producer nodeos pass signature validation but fail internal execution checks, like assert failure. This overflow of failed transactions puts strain on block producers and API nodeos, affecting the CPU time usage for regular transactions.

## Subjective Billing

To address this, subjective billing was introduced. It aims to bill failed transactions and reject any accounts that go subjectively negative. Successful transactions replace their temporary subjective billing with objective billing upon blockchain recording. While this approach significantly reduced CPU waste, it can result in inconsistent billing across nodeos. Consequently, transactions might be lost at any point, potentially causing an account to encounter recurring resource errors and subsequent subjective billings. For a deeper dive, refer to ['An Introduction to Subjective Billing and Lost Transactions'](https://eosnetwork.com/blog/api-plus-an-introduction-to-subjective-billing-and-lost-transactions/ 'An Introduction to Subjective Billing and Lost Transactions').

## Staking and the Ranked Transaction Queue

Antelope-based blockchain users need to stake UOS for CPU and NET resources before transacting. The staking amount required, relative to transaction demands, varies with the total staked number. The "ranked transaction queue" was implemented to allow end users free transactions without staking. However, abundant transactions from high-ranking users might delay those of lower-ranking users. Such high-ranking users aren't billed for failed transactions and subjective billing doesn't completely address this issue, especially since it lets users transact without staking.

## Two Transaction Queues

To balance free network usage for end users and to ensure that staked users have access to their resources, two transaction queues have been introduced:

1. **Staked User Queue**: For users with staking (primarily developers). This queue can use up to a set CPU time percentage per block (e.g., 80%).

2. **Free User Queue**: For users without staking. This queue can use the remaining CPU time (e.g., 20%). If one queue is vacant, the other can use more CPU time.

To counter spamming from non-staking users, there is a rate limit. Exceeding a set CPU usage threshold results in users getting rate-limited. Higher transaction demands necessitate more staking. See more details in ['Transaction Queue and Rate Limiting'](./rate-limiting.html).

## Addressing Failed Transactions

A "failed transaction billing" system has been added to minimize the impact of failed transactions on both user types.

In this system, failed transactions are added to blocks. Other nodeos validate and apply the provided block billing. Failed transactions only modify billing, not the blockchain state. If a transaction fails at the API nodeos level, it's added to a speculative block but isn't broadcast to the wider network. This is distinct from subjective billing, which bills on all nodes and doesn't add billed transactions to blocks. Furthermore, subjective billing tracks billing locally per nodeos, while failed transaction billing operates only on the active BP node.

Failures are treated differently. A transaction with an invalid signature or insufficient authority will always be rejected immediately, instead of included in a block and getting billed. Some failures will also be given a second chance to run, like transactions that hit the block deadline.

<Staging>

## Failed Transactions and Subjective Billing

After failed transaction billing was implemented, subjective billing was reconsidered and it turned out that both functions work either alone or at the same time, provided that double billing issue where subjective billing may be applied twice, is solved. Objective and subjective billing will bill users in speculative mode. Objective billing will be dropped when the speculative block is dropped, whereas subjective billing will persist as usual. To solve double billing, a small internal strucure was implemened to cache subjective billing info per block, which will be used to correct double billing.

# Account Types

Accounts have a resource cost as RAM is a limited resource on the network. To generate a new account, the RAM must be paid for. In some cases Ultra might cover the costs for account creation and sponsoring RAM for development purposes, in all other cases the user or developer will have to purchase RAM from the on-chain market.

In traditional EOS blockchain accounts, the OWNER permission may change the ACTIVE permission’s keys, and the ACTIVE permission may also change its own keys. In Ultra, the ACTIVE permission may not change its own keys. This applies to both Ultra Pro Wallets and to Ultra Accounts.

## Ultra Account

Accounts created using Ultra client are referred to as Ultra Accounts. Formerly referred to as `Easy Blockchain Account` (or EBA). This type of account is managed by Ultra Backend and provides users with account recovery options in case they lose access to their account.

The name in this case is auto-generated on chain with format of `aa1aa2aa3aa4` where the positional numerals 1, 2, 3 and 4 remain in the same place for all accounts, but the letters `a` will be incremented for each new account starting from `a` and ending at `z` after which the next `a` will be incremented to a `b` and so on (e.g. `aa1aa2aa3aa4`, `aa1aa2aa3ab4`, `aa1aa2aa3ac4`, ... `aa1aa2aa3az4`, `aa1aa2aa3ba4`).

## Ultra Pro Wallet

Ultra Pro Wallets (formerly referred to as non-EBA) are equivalent to traditional EOS blockchain accounts, in that they are fully managed by the end user. These accounts are used internally by Ultra, and are recommended for developers to deploy their smart contracts to.

The name in this case is auto-generated on chain with format of `1aa2aa3aa4aa` where the positional numerals 1, 2, 3 and 4 remain in the same place for all accounts, but the letters `a` will be incremented for each new account starting from `a` and ending at `z` after which the next `a` will be incremented to a `b` and so on (e.g. `1aa2aa3aa4aa`, `1aa2aa3aa4ab`, `1aa2aa3aa4ac`, ... `1aa2aa3aa4az`, `1aa2aa3aa4ba`).

## Ultra Premium Wallet

Ownership of the account and private keys is the same as for Ultra Pro Wallet. In this case Ultra will be responsible for personally creating an account for you. The limitation on the name is that it is a single purpose name like `devname123` or `productname`.

## Ultra Corporate Wallet

Ownership of the account and private keys mirrors that of Ultra Pro Wallet. Ultra is responsible for creating these accounts. Names follow the pattern `partner.contract`, `partner.data`, `partner.account`, or `contract.partner`, etc.

## Okay, how do I make an account?

We currently allow **Ultra Accounts** to be created through the official ultra.io client which can be found at [https://ultra.io](https://ultra.io).

To create **Ultra Pro Wallet**, refer to either [Testnet tutorial](../../../tutorials/fundamentals/tutorial-generate-key-and-create-testnet-account.md) or [Mainnet guide](../../../tutorials/guides/how-to-create-ultra-pro-wallet.md).

Using our docker image you can create local accounts for testing.

title: 'Account & Permissions'

outline: [0,4]

# Accounts, Permissions, & Keys

Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, Ultra necessitates an account on the network for participation. This account employs keypairs linked to permissions, controlling access to specific network actions.

A keypair, generated through elliptic curve cryptography, involves associating private and public keys. The private key proves ownership of an account, which, in turn, has a public key assigned to one of its permissions.

Ultra accounts come with default permissions called OWNER and ACTIVE. OWNER functions as a superuser, capable of updating keys for all permissions as the root permission. ACTIVE, another default permission, can execute all actions on the account except updating keys to the OWNER permission.

Smart contracts are deployed to an account, and each action within a smart contract can have keys assigned to it. This feature allows for specific limitations on which entity, along with which keypair, can call that action.

# Actions & Transactions

Actions and transactions constitute the core elements of the Ultra network. The former refers to functions invoked from deployed smart contracts, while the latter encompasses single or combined actions submitted to a Block Producer for evaluation by the chain.

In a standard Antelope-based network, transactions are processed in the order they are received, following a first-come, first-served approach.

# Block Explorer

A block explorer is a frontend that allows a user to traverse data on the network. Typically, a block explorer will expose data such as transactions, blocks, accounts, smart contracts, and associated actions, keys, permissions, etc.

Ultra provides a block explorer, which Ultra has deployed for each of the networks that a developer may need.

# Block Production

Block production is the base function for the network. 

Each Block Producer is either producing or is on standby, waiting in the wings in case a producing team needs to be swapped out.

The production schedule decides in which order that the network sends transactions to a BP’s node. In a traditional Antelope network, this order is decided by the token holders voting the Block Producers up and down the ranks. In Ultra’s network, we tightly control the production schedule and optimize it to increase the network’s throughput.

Typically, Antelope-based networks have 21 producing BPs and many more in standby. Ultra currently has 7 producing BPs, and none in standby. 

The default block time is 500ms, meaning that a new block is produced by the network twice a second.

# Consensus

A blockchain is a decentralized peer-to-peer state machine. It has no centralized authority. While this creates a system that is devoid of corruption from a single source, it still creates a major problem.

How are any decisions made that determine the future of the network?

How do you ensure that the network stays decentralized?

In a centralized organization like a company, decisions are taken at the executive level. This isn’t possible in a blockchain because a blockchain has no such functionality. Necessary decisions must be made using “consensus mechanisms”.

## Common Consensus Mechanisms

Some of the most common consensus models used in blockchains are Proof of Work and Proof of Stake. 

### Proof of Work (PoW)

In Proof of Work, miner nodes compete to find a nonce added to the header of a block which causes the block to have some desired property (typically a certain number of zeros in the most significant bits of the cryptographic hash of the block header). By making it computationally expensive to find such nonces that make the blocks valid, it becomes difficult for attackers to create an alternative fork of the blockchain that would be accepted by the rest of the network as the best chain. The main disadvantage of Proof of Work is that the security of the network depends on spending a lot of resources on computing power to find the nonces.

### Proof of Stake (PoS)

In Proof-of-Stake, nodes that own the largest stake or percentage of some asset have equivalent decision power. In other words, voting power is proportional to the stake held. One interesting variant is Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) in which a large number of participants or stakeholders elect a smaller number of delegates, which in turn make decisions for them.

### Proof of Authority (PoA)

**Proof of Authority is what Ultra is currently based on.**

Proof of Authority (PoA) is a reputation-based consensus algorithm that introduces a practical and efficient solution for blockchain networks (especially the private ones). The term was proposed in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder and former CTO Gavin Wood. 

The PoA consensus algorithm leverages the value of identities, which means that block validators are not staking coins but their own reputation instead. Therefore, PoA blockchains are secured by the validating nodes that are arbitrarily selected as trustworthy entities.

The Proof of Authority model relies on a limited number of block validators and this is what makes it a highly scalable system. Blocks and transactions are verified by pre-approved participants, who act as moderators of the system.

title: 'POWER'

# POWER Resource

## What is POWER?

POWER is required for sending transactions to the network, it represents the share of total resources that an account has to transact. You can transact without any POWER, but if enough people with more POWER are transacting, your transactions might be delayed or rejected.

## What is it used for?

To make sure that vendors and other important businesses on the network have the ability to run operations without being interrupted. For example if a game company has a big release coming out, they want to prioritize their transactions going through over the rest of the network for the duration of their event. Without POWER it may be possible encounter rate limiting which will prevent any additional transactions to be pushed

title: 'Predicate System'

outline: [0,4]
order: -96
---

# Predicate System

As part of Ultra’s larger strategy to enable friction-less transactions on the network, we provide a predicate system that allows developers to cover their user’s resource costs.

Developers may now allow certain actions to be performed by other accounts at the cost of their own POWER resources using the allowpred action. Resources may be revoked using the revokepred action. Developers may also specify a predicate action to call to verify if this action should be paid or not (e.g. check that a user is a premium user or is whitelisted).

## Predicate API

| Optional | Type     | Name               | Description                                                     |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| No       | name     | payer              | The account that adds a predicate.                              |
| No       | name     | paid_contract      | The contract that account will allow paying for                 |
| No       | name     | paid_action        | The action from the contract that account will allow paying for |
| No       | uint64_t | max power usage    | The limit for POWER usage in UOS for paid action                |
| Yes      | name     | predicate_contract | The predicate contract that will be used for inline action call |
| Yes      | name     | predicate_action   | The action that will be used to create inline action call       |


**Example**

```ts
cleos push action eosio allowpred '["<payer_account>", "<paid_contract>", "<paid_action>", <max_allowed_cpu_usage>, <predicate_contract (optional)>, <predicate_action (optional)>]' -p <payer_account>@active
```

```ts
cleos push action eosio allowpred '["alice", "eosio", "buyram", 2000, "ubisoft", "buyrampred"]' -p alice
```

A unique @payer permission of the developer account must be specified to utilize this system. An account with the @payer permission provided will be the one to pay for the whole transaction but only if all actions in the transaction are allowed by the payer, and all predicate actions are successfully executed. If @payer is present in the transaction then he will be ranked in the transaction queue described above instead of the first authorizer.

# Public and Private Keys

Ultra uses an elliptic curve key pair consists of a public key (used for verification) and a private key (kept secret for signing transactions), enabling secure digital interactions on the Ultra blockchain.

A keypair is **required** for most blockchain development besides reading APIs. If you are going to publish a smart contract, sign a transaction, or even sign a message you're going to need a keypair.

::: details Additional Information

#### What is a Public Key?

A public key is primarily used for cryptographic verification. In the context of blockchain or digital signatures, it allows others to confirm that a message or transaction was indeed signed by the corresponding private key without revealing the private key itself. This verification process is crucial for ensuring the integrity and authenticity of data in secure communications and transactions.

#### What is a Private Key?

A private key, a secret alphanumeric code, is used to digitally sign transactions or messages. It grants control over associated assets or data in blockchain systems. Essential for secure communication, it enables identity verification and access control, emphasizing the need for stringent security measures to prevent unauthorized access or loss.

:::

### Generate a Keypair

In most cases we don't recommend generating private keys online. However, if you are using this for our test network it is safe to use there. Otherwise, seek out some of the additional ways to generate a key pair safely. Such as using [cleos](../tools/cleos.md).

title: 'RAM Policy'

outline: [0,4]
order: -95
---

# RAM Policy

The RAM pricing curve utilizes a Bancor algorithm which leads the RAM prices to go up when the RAM supply goes down. Ultra ensures that all blockchain users share the same RAM market and thus the price is the same for every account wishing to utilize it.

Ultra can adjust RAM prices by reserving or releasing some of the RAM from the market and by changing the parameter called connector weight which steepens the curve.

## RAM purchase rules

Any account can purchase RAM using buyram or buyrambytes action. RAM is purchased with UOS tokens.

By default new accounts can only purchase and have in use up to 10 KB of RAM. Ultra can change this limit with setramthresh action.

Once the account provides the KYB information the maximum RAM purchase limit is removed. Ultra requires that an account not have more than 10 MB of RAM that is not in use. If an account has more than 10 MB of RAM purchased but unused then this account will be unable to purchase more RAM. This limit can be changed with setramthrkyc.

For developers, a special whitelist is maintained which allows Ultra to set any desired unused RAM limit for specified accounts. Accounts are whitelisted with whitelistact and removed from whitelist with unwhtlistact actions.

Only up to 10 MB can be purchased by any account in a single buy operation. Ultra can change this limit with setramprchlm.

## RAM gifting

Ultra can gift RAM using giftram action to any account bypassing any RAM limitations from the section above. Gifting RAM requires that some of the RAM is still reserved by Ultra and not available on the market.

## RAM fees

Each RAM purchase has a UOS token fee based on the percent of tokens used for the purchase. By default 5% fee is applied to each RAM purchase. Ultra can alter this fee with setramfee action.

## RAM refund policy

Accounts may decide to refund the RAM they have purchased using refundram action and in this case the refund price is calculated based on the amount of token spent by this account for RAM purchases and the amount of RAM gifted to this account by Ultra. This allows Ultra to fairly refund the RAM purchase and avoid RAM price speculation since the refund amount does not depend on the current RAM price. Subtracted fees are not refunded.

## RAM reservation and supply increase

The default eosio.system contract setting specifies that 32 GB are available on the RAM market from the start and 32 GB are reserved by Ultra. Any additional RAM added to the system using setram action will go to Ultra first. Ultra may decide to gift ram to an account with giftram or release RAM into the market by returning it using the rtnrambytes action. Ultra can manually reserve some RAM with resvrambytes action. Additionally the setramrate action can be used by Ultra to add a specified amount of bytes to the RAM market with each block.

## Sponsored objects

Each non-system blockchain account has a sponsored tier assigned to it. This tier specifies the amount of account information objects (permissions, keys) that can be stored by this account for free (Ultra uses its RAM for storage). Ultra can specify a default tier for new accounts with setdeftier action, can create new tiers using createtier, and update existing tiers with updatetier. Only Ultra can change the accounts tier using the settier action and can disable this sponsored system for specific users with the settiereligb action.

The goal of this system is to allow regular users to have some necessary account information stored free of charge and to encourage users to utilize the blockchain without spending UOS tokens.

# Introduction
The Ultra Blockchain employs two main concepts to enhance performance and security: **Resource Allocation** and **Rate Limiting**. This document aims to explain these concepts and how users can effectively interact with the Ultra Blockchain.

# Resource Allocation
When a user stakes UOS (Ultra Blockchain's native currency), they're eligible to use a portion of our CPU resources. The ratio of resource allocation is determined by the stake amount of an account relative to the total amount staked in the system. This is, however, not a strict ratio due to the resource allocation mechanism.

# Positive and Negative Accounts
Accounts that use less CPU than is available to them are considered "positive accounts", while those that exceed their CPU allocation are "negative accounts". In the protocol level, there are two transaction queues, the positive queue for positive accounts and the negative queue for negative accounts.

To ensure fair resource usage, Ultra Blockchain reserves 20% of all CPU resources for negative accounts. This results in a 80-20% processing time ratio where block producers process transactions from the positive queue for 320ms and from the negative queue for 80ms, if the block producing time is 400ms.

# Queue Processing
The normal processing order adheres to the 80-20% ratio. However, if there aren't enough transactions in the positive queue, the block producer can pick transactions from the negative queue and vice versa. This dynamic reallocation ensures efficient use of resources.

# Rate Limiting
Rate limiting is the second core concept, providing safeguards for the network. Transactions from positive accounts are added to the positive queue, while those from negative accounts go into the negative queue. Furthermore, negative accounts are categorized based on whether they fall above or below the rate limit threshold.

# Rate Limit Classification for Negative Accounts
Negative accounts are categorized based on whether they fall below or above a configurable rate limit threshold (currently set at 50ms). If an account's properties fulfill the following inequality:
```
used cpu >= available cpu + rate_limit_threshold
```
then it is considered "above the rate limit threshold" (or briefly, "above the threshold"). Conversely, if the inequality is not satisfied, the account is "below the rate limit threshold".

Transactions from accounts below the threshold face no restrictions. However, if an account is categorized as above the threshold, it is subject to both "incoming rate limiting" and "execution rate limiting".

# Incoming Rate Limiting
This applies before a transaction from an "above the threshold" account is added to the negative queue. The system checks if the incoming rate limiting timestamp is less than the current timestamp. If true, the transaction is **added** to the queue and the incoming rate limiting timestamp is updated to:
```
now + abs(used CPU - available CPU) * 100
```
 If not, the transaction is **rejected** with an incoming rate limiting exception.

# Execution Rate Limiting
This mechanism activates just before a transaction from an "above the threshold" account is executed. The system checks if the execution rate limiting timestamp is less than the current time. If true, the transaction is **executed**, and the execution rate limiting timestamp is updated to
```
now + abs(used CPU - available CPU) * 100
```
If not, the transaction is **rejected** before execution with an execution rate limiting exception.

![Transaction processing chart](/images/transaction_queue.png)
*Transaction processing chart*

# Switching Queues
In case an account becomes negative while its transaction is in the positive queue, the transaction is moved to the negative queue, applying the rules specified for the negative queue.

With these mechanisms, Ultra Blockchain ensures efficient resource allocation and transaction processing while preventing resource abuse. Always remember to monitor your CPU usage and stake enough UOS to maintain a positive account status.

title: 'Smart Contracts'

outline: [0, 5]
order: -98
prev: false

# Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are pieces of code that are applied on-chain and have functions that can be called to run code.

Think of it like a REST endpoint that requires a POST request to run under specific parameters.

## Language

Smart contracts on Ultra are written in C++ and compiled down into Web Assembly.

It's not as intimidating as you think; here's an example `hello-world.cpp` contract.

::: details hello-world.cpp

```cpp
#include <eosio/eosio.hpp>
#include <eosio/print.hpp>

namespace mycontract {
    using namespace std;
    using namespace eosio;

    CONTRACT hello : public eosio::contract {
        using eosio::contract::contract;

        public:
            ACTION hi(name user) {
                print("Hi there, ", user.value, "!");
            }
   };
}
```

:::

## Building a contract

There are 3 options to build a contract at the moment:

-   Via [cdt-cpp](../../../tutorials/docker/getting-started.md) with docker
-   Via [contract-builder](../../../products/contract-builder/index.md) tool
-   Via [VS Code extension](../../../tutorials/smart-contracts/compile.md)

VS Code extension is the easiest one to start with. However, if your project has non-trivial build steps (i.e uses scripts for code generation)
it's better to use the docker option.

# Transaction Failure Trace

When transaction is locally accepted by the API node there is still a potential for it to fail once it reaches the producer node. In such cases the transaction error will be recorded on the blockchain and you will be able to find the error trace in the block explorer

## Are all failed transactions get recorded on the chain?

Failed transactions are not guaranteed to be added to the block so it is still necessary to wait for it's expiration date and blocks irreversibility status to identify it the transaction failed or not. But if you do manage to find your transaction in an irreversible block (either executed or failed) then you can be sure about it's status

## How to see a failed transaction in block explorer

If you know the transaction ID then by simply searching the transaction ID in block explorer you would be able to find if it executed successfully or failed

# Wallets

A wallet is a piece of software that securely holds a user’s keys so that they may interact with an open network without risk.

The wallet does this by holding the user’s keys in a locally encrypted vault. When the user wishes to sign a transaction on an open network, the client sends a request to the user’s wallet, which asks the user to decrypt the keys and compares them to the public key in the requesting transaction. If they match, the wallet confirms and allows the user to sign the transaction.

![](/images/wallet-signing-transaction.jpg)

There are many different types of wallets available for EOSIO-based networks. The most basic is Keosd, which comes as part of the developer kit provided. Additionally, there are custodial, non-custodial, and hardware wallets. Each of these have their upsides and downsides.

Keosd runs in the command-line and is generally used by developers for interacting directly with the open network.

Custodial wallets allow a third party to hold your keys.

Non-custodial wallets are self-managed.

A hardware wallet is a physical device that keeps an account’s keys secure within the device, and asks a user for a confirmation on the device to complete the transaction.

# Key Differences

Ultra is based on [Antelope Blockchain technology](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap) and is maintained at feature parity with the standard releases, there are many key changes that have been implemented by our blockchain team. These changes alter the way that Ultra allocates resources, assigns permissions, and runs the blockchain and its schedule.

## Choosing Block Producers

As an enterprise blockchain network, Ultra carefully selects and elects Block Producers manually. There is no voting process. Block Producers' accounts are created by Ultra, with the keys being generated by the Block Producer themselves.

Block producers are given a specific order based on their geographical location and the distance between each producer. The goal is to reduce the distance between producers and the overall latency.

See [Proof of Authority](./antelope-ultra/consensus.md#proof-of-authority-poa)

## Block Producer Schedule

During the initial Testnets and Mainnet, it will be Ultra who is defining the Block Producer schedule. There is not an ordered, elected ranking like on other Antelope chains. There is no voting for Block Producers.

All block producers are given an equal opportunity to produce blocks for the chain.

## Block Producer Rewards

Ultra’s block production rewards are divided up according to how many blocks they produce. A Block Producer that successfully produces all blocks will be able to claim the full Block Producer reward.

The compensation that a Block Producer receives is paid out in **UOS tokens**. The reward is always calculated as the equivalent of a set USD sum that is agreed upon when the Block Producer signs the contract with Ultra.

## Transactions Ranking

On the Ultra blockchain, the ranking mechanism for the queuing of transactions has been substantially altered to ensure that

*   Transactions critical to the Ultra network get processed with priority
    
*   Transactions from users who do not have enough resources can still access the network
    

## CPU/NET Resources

Extensive changes have been made by Ultra to the core concept of **CPU/NET**. On Ultra these have been combined into a simplified, single resource called POWER. User accounts stake **UOS** to gain **POWER**. Dapp user can pay for their users' transaction **POWER** usage.

**RAM**

The most common or important usage of RAM is free, account creation for example. Users don’t need to purchase RAM for simple blockchain usage. Developers have the option to buy more for deployment of smart contracts that require it.

Read more in the [RAM Policy](./antelope-ultra/ram-policy.md) section.

## Accounts

Blockchain accounts on the Ultra network are free (up to a certain number of accounts per user) since it is Ultra who assumes the cost of the **RAM** required to create a new account. For users who require additional accounts, they can purchase extra RAM as required. To begin with, ultra will be the only one that can create a new account.

## Permissions

The Ultra blockchain has also made alterations at the protocol level to how permissions are applied. In a traditional Antelope blockchain, permission may change itself. On Ultra, only a parent authority may change a child’s permission. This means that, for example, **ACTIVE** permission must be changed by the **OWNER** permission, and can not be changed by the **ACTIVE** permission.

**Veto Power**

As an enterprise-focused blockchain solution, Ultra retains veto power over proposals that it deems improper or malicious. For example, a proposal to upgrade to an undesired system contract implementation which could potentially undermine the Ultra blockchain.

**Premium Names**

Premium names are not currently supported.

**Chain activation**

Only Ultra can activate the chain.

# Compile a Contract

You can follow [Create A Contract](./create-a-contract.md) to create a simple Hello World contract.

Or example contract can found at this https://github.com/ultraio/eosio.cdt/tree/master/examples/hello

## Compile via CLI

Follow these steps to compile your contract

### Step 1

Navigate to the hello folder in examples (./examples/hello), you should then see the `./src/hello.cpp` file

### Step 2

Run the following commands

<Staging>

```shell script
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cdt-cpp -abigen ../src/hello.cpp -o hello.wasm -I ../include/
```

</Staging>

<Mainnet>

```shell script
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cdt-cpp -abigen ../src/hello.cpp -o hello.wasm -I ../include/
```

</Mainnet>

<Experimental>

```shell script
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cdt-cpp -abigen ../src/hello.cpp -o hello.wasm -I ../include/
```

</Experimental>

This will generate 2 files

- The compiled binary wasm, `hello.wasm`
- The generated ABI file, `hello.abi`

## Compile via Cmake

You can have a look at `CMakeLists.txt` in `./examples/hello/src` as an example on how to configure a Cmake file.

```typescript
project(hello)

set(EOSIO_WASM_OLD_BEHAVIOR "Off")
find_package(eosio.cdt)

add_contract( hello hello hello.cpp )
target_include_directories( hello PUBLIC ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/../include )
target_ricardian_directory( hello ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/../ricardian )
```

Follow these steps to compile your contract

### Step 1

Navigate to the hello folder in examples (./examples/hello), you should then see the `./src/hello.cpp` file

### Step 2

Run the following commands

```shell script
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

This will generate 2 files under `./build/hello` directory

- The compiled binary wasm, `hello.wasm`
- The generated ABI file, `hello.abi`

# Create a Contract

Let's start with a simple smart contract that produces the traditional `Hello World`.

This tutorial introduces the following key concepts:

- EOSIO Contract Development Toolkit: The toolchain and libraries used to build smart contracts
- Webassembly (WASM): The virtual machine used to execute a portable binary-code format, hosted in nodeos
- Application Binary Interfaces (ABI): The interface that defines how data is marshalled to and from the webassembly virtual machine
- Smart Contracts: The code that defines actions and transactions which may be executed on a blockchain

This tutorial shows how to:

- Create a simple smart contract with a hi action
- Compile and deploy the smart contract to an EOSIO blockchain
- Use the command line to call the hi action of the smart contract

## Before you Begin

This tutorial requires the following:

- Knowledge of the C++ programming language
- A code editor or IDE
- A fully configured local development environment

Once you complete the tutorial, you should have created a Hello World smart contract and deployed the smart contract on a blockchain.

## Procedure to create hello.cpp

Follow this procedure to create the Hello World smart contract. Normally you create two files - the header or `.hpp` file which contains the declarations for the smart contract class and the `.cpp` file, which contains the implementation of the smart contract actions. In this simple example, you only use a `.cpp` file.

### 1. Create a new directory called hello to store your smart contract file

```sh
mkdir hello
```

Go to the new directory

```sh
cd hello
```

### 2. Create a new file, `hello.cpp`, and open it in your preferred text editor

```sh
touch hello.cpp
```

### 3. Write the smart contract

Follow these four steps and add this code to the `hello.cpp` file.

#### Step 1. Import the eosio base library with the include directive.

Add the line:

```cpp
#include <eosio/eosio.hpp>
```

#### Step 2. The `eosio.hpp` contains classes required to write a smart contract, including `eosio::contract`. Create a standard C++11 class and inherit from the `eosio::contract` class. Use the `[[eosio::contract]]` attribute to inform the `EOSIO.CDT` compiler this is a smart contract.

Add the line:

```cpp
class [[eosio::contract]] hello : public eosio::contract {};
```

The `EOSIO.CDT` compiler automatically generates the main dispatcher and the `ABI file`. The dispatcher routes action calls to the correct smart contract action. The compiler will create one when using the `eosio::contract` attribute. Advanced programmers can customize this behavior by defining their own dispatcher.

#### Step 3. Add a public access specifier and a using-declaration to introduce base class members from `eosio::contract`. You can now use the default base class constructor.

Add these lines:

```cpp
public:
	using eosio::contract::contract;
```

#### Step 4. Add a `hi` public action. This action accepts an `eosio::name` parameter, and prints **Hello** concatenated with the `eosio::name` parameter.

Add these line:

```cpp
	[[eosio::action]] void hi( eosio::name user ) {
		print( "Hello, ", user);
	}
```

The `[[eosio::action]]` attribute lets the compiler know this is an action.

The `hello.cpp` file should now look like this:

```cpp
#include <eosio/eosio.hpp>
class [[eosio::contract]] hello : public eosio::contract {
  public:
      using eosio::contract::contract;
      [[eosio::action]] void hi( eosio::name user ) {
         print( "Hello, ", user);
      }
};
```

# Contract Development Kit (CDT)

All information about Contract Development Kit on how to develop a smart contract.

EOSIO.CDT (Contract Development Toolkit) is a toolchain for WebAssembly (WASM) and a set of tools to facilitate smart contract development for the EOSIO platform. In addition to being a general purpose WebAssembly toolchain, EOSIO specific optimizations are available to support building EOSIO smart contracts. 

This toolchain is built around Clang 9, which means that EOSIO.CDT has the most currently available optimizations and analyses from LLVM, but as the WASM target is still considered experimental, some optimizations are incomplete or not available.

## cdt-cpp

cdt-cpp is a tool for compiling smart contracts.

It will compile c++ source code to corresponding compiled binary wasm and generated ABI file.

outline: [0,4]

# Cleos Usage

Cleos is a command line tool that will allow you to interface with various HTTP APIs provided from nodeos instances. Cleos can be used to lookup accounts, deploy contracts, interface with contracts, and much more.

## Who is it for?

* Developers
* Advanced Users

## Obtaining Cleos

We have created a Docker image that has pre-created scripts, tools, and pre-packaged binaries. Cleos is already included inside of the Docker image.

Individual binaries are not currently available for download.

[Docker Image Usage](../../../tutorials/docker/docker-image-usage.md)

## Usage

Inside the Docker Container the following can be executed for general usage.

```sh
cleos --help
```

Additional help is supported for all individual options inside of cleos.

```sh
cleos wallet --help
cleos wallet create --help
cleos get --help
cleos get table --help
```

### External APIs

If you are using cleos you may find yourself needing to interface with an external API. This can be done with the `-u` option.

[See this API section](../../../products/chain-api/index.md) for information on block producer endpoints that are publicly available.

**Example**

```sh
cleos -u https://someurl.com/xyz/ get table eosio eosio global
```

## Wallets

A wallet can be defined as a secure place where private keys can be stored. 

Cleos has its own wallet software called `keosd` that will assist you with securely storing your private key. This additional piece of software that is packaged with `cleos` can be used through `cleos` itself.

* Developers are responsible for backing up their own private keys
* Remember to store your wallet password
* Do not share private keys in public spaces / channels

_A wallet may not be stored between sessions while using a Docker Image, ensure you backup any private keys you create if they need to be used again._

### Basic Usage

```sh
cleos wallet --help
```

### Wallet Rules

* Multiple wallets can exist
* Multiple wallets can be unlocked at the same time
* Any transaction will automatically scan unlocked wallets for a key with permission to the account
* Accessing a specific wallet requires --name
  * This only applies to wallet based commands with cleos

### Create a Wallet

Below is the command used to create a wallet and print out a `password` which you should store somewhere to eventually unlock a wallet. By default a wallet will eventually lock itself over time.

```sh
cleos wallet create --to-console
```

A successful creation of the wallet will respond with:

```sh
Creating wallet: default
Save password to use in the future to unlock this wallet.
Without password imported keys will not be retrievable.
"SomeReallyLongPassword"
```

### Creating a Named Wallet

There are times a developer may need a specifically named wallet to interface with. You can easily name a wallet with the following command.

```sh
cleos wallet create --name=CustomName --to-console
```

The name chosen will be used for the file name, and the wallet itself. 

### Unlocking a Wallet

When a wallet is locked it will not allow any cleos based commands that require transacting, setting contracts, etc. to be called. Below is a command that can be used to unlock the wallet.

```sh
cleos wallet unlock
```

After running the command it will prompt you for a password. It may appear like nothing is being written when you type or paste your password (right-click) but actually something is being written.

A successful unlock will respond with:

```sh
Unlocked: default
```

### Importing a Private Key

There are two ways to import a private key to your wallet.

This first version will prompt for a private key to import

```sh
cleos wallet import
```

This second version will not prompt the user and will retain the private key in the `history` command. 

It is **not recommended** to use it, but it could be used for development purposes.

```sh
cleos wallet import --private-key SomePrivateKey
```

### List Keys

No, this does not reveal private keys. Instead, it lists all of your public keys.

```sh
cleos wallet keys
```

If you do want to list private keys from unlocked wallets the following command can be used.

```sh
cleos wallet private_keys
```

### Create a Key Pair

The following command will print a private and public key to console without importing it into the wallet.

```sh
cleos create key --to-console
```

To import a key on creation, then the following command will suffice.

```sh
cleos wallet create_key
```

### Wallet Infinite Unlock

If you find a need for a wallet that almost never locks itself then seek the following page:

[keosd - Infinite Unlock](./keosd.md#wallet-infinite-unlock)

## Accounts

Accounts can be created in a variety of ways but it is important to understand that on the Ultra Blockchain a Ultra Pro Wallet is necessary to deploy smart contracts. 

Meaning, developers who wish **to deploy a smart contract** on the production network should use the [Wallet Extension](../../../tutorials/guides/how-to-create-ultra-pro-wallet.md) or [Ultra Tool Kit](../../../blockchain/contracts/system-contract/system-actions/newnonebact.md) to create an Ultra Pro Wallet.

### Account Rules

Account names are automatically generated sequentially based on the previous name. Developers are not required to provide a name for an account, developers are given one.

_Requires system contracts to be deployed, and applied on Testnet and Mainnet._

### Name Type Rules

There are rules with using the `eosio::name` type and account names.

* Can be up to 12 character(s)
* Must only contain digits 1-5
* Must only contain letters a-z
* Must be lowercase only

_Developers are unable to choose their names on Testnet and production networks._

### Resource Information

You do not need to have UOS in the account to deploy smart contracts or do general transactions. This is all shared through Ultra's POWER system which splits resources amongst multiple accounts as they are created.

This being said, you will need RAM in order to deploy a smart contract. You may acquire RAM during the account creation process, from the RAM market, or by creating an unlimited account which has no RAM limitations.

### Accounts for Testnet Network & Production Network

However, **an Ultra Pro Wallet is necessary for deploying smart contracts.**. 

In a local network, a developer has full control over how accounts are created, and when they can be created. Refer to the instructions below to use `cleos` to create accounts.

### Creating an Account

This applies when you have a system contract deployed to the chain, and need to create an account.

```sh
cleos system newaccount ultra.eosio accountname SomePublicKey --transfer --gift-ram-kbytes 1024000 -p ultra.eosio
```

This permission is inaccessible on Testnet and Mainnet.

_Note: Using the `ultra.eosio` permission should be possible when launching the chain with the javascript framework included in the image._

### Creating an Ultra Pro Wallet

Allow user to create new Ultra Pro Wallet when the system contract is deployed, with expected cost should not be larger than max payment. Cost calculation will base on config from newactconfig. All names will be auto-generated, for details on the format see [this page](../../../blockchain/general/antelope-ultra/account-types.md).

```sh
cleos push action eosio newnonebact '{"creator":"alice", "owner":{"threshold":1,"keys":[{"key":"EOS7i1PgEe399sjbhhS6umNFU6okzit96chj8NtpBRzy6XpDYXUH9","weight":1}],"accounts":[],"waits":[]}, "active":{"threshold":1,"keys":[{"key":"EOS7i1PgEe399sjbhhS6umNFU6okzit96chj8NtpBRzy6XpDYXUH9","weight":1}],"accounts":[],"waits":[]}, "max_payment":"1.00000000 UOS"}' -p alice
```

### Accessing Account Info

Once an account is created you can check if it exists on chain by performing a `get` against the account.

```
cleos get account accountname
```

### Updating Account Permissions

Account permissions can be incredibly complex at times depending on the needs of the permission structure.

Please keep in mind that the `eosio` account must have the `eosio.system` contract deployed to to the account in order to use this functionality.

**Basic Permission Hierarchy**

Almost all accounts that are created always have the same permission structure by default.

* owner
  * The highest permission
* active
  * The lowest permission

_To change active permission we need permission of the owner permission_

**Permission Structure**

```json
{
  "threshold": 1,
  "accounts": [
    {
      "permission": {
        "actor": "anotheracc1",
        "permission": "active"
      },
      "weight": 1
    }
  ],
  "keys": [
    {
      "key": "SomePublicKey",
      "weight": 1
    }
  ],
  "waits": []
}
```

**Explanation of Permission Structure**

The above structure may look quite complex, but this can be broken down.

* threshold
  * Threshold determines how many signatures are needed from both the keys, and accounts section to fulfill this permission we are creating.
  * If we set threshold to 2 and we have 2 keys listed, then we need to use the multi-signature protocol to fulfill any actions using this permission.
* accounts
  * This is a list of accounts that can be used to fulfill the permission we are creating.
  * This means that multiple accounts can be chained together.
  * There is no limit to the amount of accounts we can add to this array.
  * weight
    * This determines how much is given to the threshold when this specific account signs a transaction. If we set the weight to 2 and we need a threshold of 2, this one account can completely fulfill the threshold necessary to sign a transaction.
* keys
  * This is a list of keys that can be used to fulfill the permission we are creating.
  * This means that maybe you and a friend, or a bunch of other people can all put their keys under this one specific permission. You can then have any of the keys sign on behalf of this permission to meet the threshold.
  * There is no limit to the amount of keys we add to this array.
  * weight
    * Same as the 'weight' written above in the accounts section.

When all adjustments are made to the above structure we can `stringify` the json structure to pass it through cleos.

**Pushing the Update Auth**

Keep in mind that updating authorization will require the permission above the permission we are modifying. Example being if we are modifying the `active` permission we need the `owner` permission to do so.

```sh
cleos set account permission account1 active '{"threshold":1,"accounts":[{"permission":{"actor":"anotheracc1","permission":"active"},"weight":1}],"keys":[{"key":"SomePublicKey","weight":1}],"waits":[]}' -p account1@owner
```

### Updating Account Link Authorization

Preface, `linkauth` allows a specific `account permission` to be linked to a specific smart contract's `action`. This will allow only that specific permission under the account to interface with a smart contract `action`.

In short, if a permission is created for an account that has a public key that is used inside of an application it is better to only have that permission interface with very specific actions. This prevents potential vulnerabilities when creating applications that interface with the blockchain.

```sh
cleos push action eosio linkauth '["someaccount","eosio.token","transfer", "somepermission"]' -p someaccount
```

### Code Based Permissions

The `eosio.code` permission will allow a smart contract to call other smart contracts to invoke other actions. 

The best example of this is creating a smart contract that requires funds to be transfered from the contract account to the user account without the contract account's direct permission.

```sh
cleos set account permission contractaccount active --add-code
```

## Contract Deployment

Smart contracts allow accounts to interact with an `action` inside of a compiled smart contract that runs specific code to create a result.

Deploying a compiled smart contract is how developers, and users alike will interface with the blockchain. 

An example of a smart contract would be the `eosio.token` contract that also has the `transfer` action. This allows users to transfer the native token between accounts.

### Deploying a Smart Contract

At this stage it is assumed that a `wasm` and `abi` file have been created to deploy the smart contract.

Assume the following file structure:

```
contractA\
  |- contractA.wasm
  |- contractA.abi
```

_Note: The folder, and files must have the same name._

```sh
cleos set contract someaccount ./contractA -p someaccount@active
```

The chain should reply that you have deployed your contract successfully.

## Transactions

A transaction can be defined as a way to call a specific function in a smart contract that will run some code on-chain and create a result on-chain.

### Pushing a Transaction

If all permissions are correct, and you are interacting with a smart contract the following example should be sufficient for interacting with most smart contracts.

Assume the following action in `C++`.

```cpp
// Notice how usera is parameter 1, and userb is parameter 2 in the array in the example below. This is how all actions are interfaced with.
[[eosio::action]] void test( eosio::name usera, eosio::name userb ) {
  print( "Hello to, ", usera);
  print( "Hello to, ", userb);
}
```

We have to pass two parameters to our action: `usera`, and `userb`. Both of which are account names.

Assume the account the contract is deployed under is `hello`.

```sh
cleos push action hello test '["acc1", "acc2"]' -p someaccount
```

This will push the action, and we should receive some output back from the action.

Here is another example with the `eosio.token` account and `transfer` action.

```sh
cleos push action eosio.token transfer '["acc1", "someaccount", "4.00000000 UOS", "some transfer"]' -p someaccount
```

Upon successful transaction, it will return a unique identifier which can be used to fetch that transaction with `cleos get transaction`.

## Get Data

Cleos allows for a lot of utility as far as getting data from the chain. Anything from token balances, tables, and even account information is fair game with this tool.

### Usage

See the full capabilities of `get` with the command below.

```sh
cleos get --help
```

### Accounts

Get all account information, and permissions.

```sh
cleos get account someaccount
```

### Tables

Tables are defined inside of smart contracts. This section will cover how to fetch data from a table, and not how to write to a table. Smart contract actions often write to tables automatically, and the scope of writing to a table will not be covered in this section.

Tables are based on a specific format which revolves around `contract`, `scope (account_name)` and `table_name`. 

Example of retrieving data from the global eosio table.

```sh
cleos get table eosio eosio global
```

### Understanding Scope

A scope for a table serves as an indexing key. It may be a variation of types ranging from `uint8` to `checksum256` (sha256 hash). It is most commonly a `name` type, as 
quite often tables are scoped to an account name. 

A good example of how scope may be used for easy retrieval of stored information would be for a chess contract.

```
cleos get table chess <GAME_ID> turns
```

Or even a way to get the games a user is participating in

```
cleos get table chess <USER_ID> games
```

The definition of how a scope is used is decided at the smart contract level but it is important to understand that this is an option for tables when fetching their individual data.

### Transaction

Transactions can be fetched through their unique identifier.

```sh
cleos get transaction someuid
```

### Block

Blocks can be fetched through their individual block number.

```sh
cleos get block 25
```

## Closing Remarks

Cleos is a powerful command line tool that has near infinite use cases for developers and advanced users alike. It is worth exploring every option through `--help` and above we have covered some of the most used command line options that the blockchain team at Ultra uses on a near daily basis.

# Keosd Usage

Keosd is a program that runs in the background to help store priate keys, and sign transactions. It's a secure and encrypted key storage program.

## Who is it for?

* Developers
* Advanced Users

## Obtaining Keosd

We have created a Docker image that has pre-created scripts, tools, and pre-packaged binaries. Keosd is already included inside of the Docker image.

Individual binaries are not currently available for download.

[Docker Image Usage](../../../tutorials/docker/docker-image-usage.md)

## Usage

Inside the Docker Container the following can be executed for general usage.

```sh
keosd --help
```

### Basic Usage

Keosd can be ran by itself without even specifying `help`. It by default creates all wallet files in the `~/eosio-wallet` directory.

It is highly suggested to use `cleos` in tandem with `keosd`, or let `cleos` run `keosd` by itself. Using any `cleos wallet` functions will automatically perform all `keosd` actions.


### Wallet Infinite Unlock

If you find a need for a wallet that almost never locks itself you will need to stop the keosd service first.

```sh
pkill -f keosd
```

keosd can be ran by itself with a specific timeout for the unlock, and the command below will also run it in the background.

```sh
nohup keosd --http-server-address=localhost:8899 --http-max-response-time-ms=30000 --unlock-timeout=999999 &

## Who is it for?

* Smart contract developers
* Producing blocks, and being a Block Producer
* Replicating Staging and Production networks locally

## Obtaining Nodeos

We have created a Docker image that has pre-created scripts, tools, and pre-packaged binaries. Nodeos is already included inside of the Docker image.

### Starting a Chain

Starting a chain straight from the binaries can be a daunting task; but just getting the basic startup without any additional `smart contract` deployment.

Assume the following file structure:

```sh

```

A fresh chain can be started by running the following command.

```sh
nodeos --genesis-json eosio/config/genesis.json \
    --config-dir eosio/config \
    --data-dir eosio/data \
    --blocks-dir eosio/data/blocks \
    --producer-name eosio
```

Once the above command is ran, it will use the directories `config`, `blocks`, and `data` to store the various chain data and you should see `eosio` as the producer who is producing blocks.

### Restarting the Chain

If the chain has already started you can simply use the **above command** once again to completely restart the chain. Restarting with the same command will use the same blocks from the previous session.

### Wiping the Chain

When stopping the chain, you may wish to restart the chain again with new blocks. Simply run the command below to the wipe the chain. Adjust the command as needed for your folder structure.

**Terminal Commands in Docker Container**

```sh
rm -rf /opt/eosio/data/blocks && \
  rm -rf /opt/eosio/data/snapshots && \
  rm -rf /opt/eosio/data/state && \
  rm -rf /opt/eosio/data/config/protocol_features && \
  rm -rf /opt/eosio/data/eosio
```

_After next startup your blocks should start at #1_

### Before Synchronizing Nodeos

There are a few standard rules you should be aware of...

* You should all be using the same `genesis.json`
* Synchronizing Nodes CAN take a long time...
  * You should probably get a snapshot, and load from snapshot
  * You should probably get a blocks.log, and load from blocks.log
  * Both of these will speed up synchronization time but are not required
* APIs can connect to block producers and other APIs
* Block producers should only connect to other block producers but allow only their own APIs in to expose them to the outside world.

_This is a format that almost all block producers today currently use._


## Configuration Files

**genesis.json**

This file is necessary to set the intitial chain parameters that can be found inside of the `eosio` `global` table for a fully launched chain. Its entire purpose is to tell the protocol how it should be producing blocks, and the restrictions for producers.

```json
{
  "initial_timestamp": "2018-09-01T12:00:00.000",
  "initial_key": "EOS6MRyAjQq8ud7hVNYcfnVPJqcVpscN5So8BhtHuGYqET5GDW5CV",
  "initial_configuration": {
    "max_block_net_usage": 1048576,
    "target_block_net_usage_pct": 1000,
    "max_transaction_net_usage": 524288,
    "base_per_transaction_net_usage": 12,
    "net_usage_leeway": 500,
    "context_free_discount_net_usage_num": 20,
    "context_free_discount_net_usage_den": 100,
    "max_block_cpu_usage": 20000000,
    "target_block_cpu_usage_pct": 1000,
    "max_transaction_cpu_usage": 15000000,
    "min_transaction_cpu_usage": 100,
    "free_cpu_basis_point": 6000,
    "free_net_basis_point": 6000,
    "ultra_veto_enabled": 1,
    "max_transaction_lifetime": 3600,
    "deferred_trx_expiration_window": 600,
    "max_transaction_delay": 3888000,
    "max_inline_action_size": 524287,
    "max_inline_action_depth": 10,
    "max_authority_depth": 10
  }
}
```

The `EOS6MRyAjQq8ud7hVNYcfnVPJqcVpscN5So8BhtHuGYqET5GDW5CV` public key is a **PUBLICLY KNOWN KEY. THIS SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION.**

Private Key: `5KQwrPbwdL6PhXujxW37FSSQZ1JiwsST4cqQzDeyXtP79zkvFD3`

**config.ini**

Defines various configurations required by `nodeos`.

The standard configuration that Ultra uses in its test environments is the following:

```ini
# Required Configurations for Ultra
agent-name = "Producer"
enable-stale-production = true
pause-on-startup = false
http-max-response-time-ms = 30000
max-transaction-time = 300000
http-validate-host = false
chain-state-db-size-mb = 4096
chain-state-db-guard-size-mb = 256
max-clients = 50

# Print contract debugging to console
contracts-console = true

# What other peers should use to connect to you
# Ideally leave these addresses as 0.0.0.0, and only change ports.
http-server-address = 0.0.0.0:8888
p2p-listen-endpoint = 0.0.0.0:9876

# What other peers you want to connect to
# This is only required if you have another peer to connect to
#p2p-peer-address = 0.0.0.0:9877

# Allow access from browser
access-control-allow-origin=*

# Plugins that nodeos should be using
plugin = eosio::net_api_plugin
plugin = eosio::http_plugin
plugin = eosio::producer_plugin
plugin = eosio::producer_api_plugin
plugin = eosio::chain_api_plugin
```

### Synchronizing Nodeos as an API

Connecting to an existing API can be done with the following configurations.

**Custom Configuration**

The configuration to use for the API is a bit different than a `producer` configuration. Here's an example API configuration.

Save this under a folder called `config/api/config.ini`

```ini
chain-state-db-size-mb = 4096
chain-state-db-guard-size-mb = 256

agent-name = "API"

max-clients = 50
p2p-max-nodes-per-host = 10

# Your HTTP Endpoint for the API
http-server-address = 0.0.0.0:8888

# Your p2p Endpoint for Others to Connect To
p2p-listen-endpoint = 0.0.0.0:9876

# Nodes to Connect To - Adjust This
p2p-peer-address = 1.2.3.4:9876
p2p-peer-address = 5.6.7.8:9876

# All the Plugins Needed for an API
plugin = eosio::history_api_plugin
plugin = eosio::chain_api_plugin

http-validate-host = false

access-control-allow-origin = *
access-control-allow-headers = *
access-control-allow-credentials = true
```

**Starting the API Node**

Depending on the directories, and folders you will want to adjust the following command accordingly.

```sh
nodeos --disable-replay-opts && \
  --data-dir /opt/eosio/data && \
  --config-dir /opt/eosio/data/config/api && \
  -c /opt/eosio/data/config/api/config.ini
```

### Synchronizing Nodeos as a Producer

The above `genesis` node or `existing nodes` need to have ports exposed to the outside world. We assume that a producing node has already exposed their ports.

**Custom Configuration**

The configuration you will want to use for the API is a bit different than a `genesis` configuration. Here's an example API configuration.

Save this under a folder called `config/producer/config.ini`

```ini
agent-name = "Producer"
max-clients = 50
p2p-max-nodes-per-host = 10
chain-state-db-size-mb = 4096
chain-state-db-guard-size-mb = 256

# What ports you are exposing to the outside world...
http-server-address = 0.0.0.0:8888
p2p-listen-endpoint = 0.0.0.0:9876

# Who you are peering with
p2p-peer-address = 10.20.1.1:9876
p2p-peer-address = 10.20.2.1:9876

enable-stale-production  = true
pause-on-startup = false

max-transaction-time = 5000
http-max-response-time-ms = 30000

# This is your producer name, you should change this and register it if you are not a genesis node.
producer-name = someproducer1

# Ensure you replace SOME_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE & SOME_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE
signature-provider=SOME_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE=KEY:SOME_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE

# All the Plugins Needed for a Producer
plugin = eosio::chain_api_plugin
plugin = eosio::net_api_plugin
plugin = eosio::producer_api_plugin
plugin = eosio::chain_plugin
plugin = eosio::producer_plugin
```

**Starting the Producing Node**

Depending on the directories, and folders you will want to adjust the following command accordingly.

```sh
nodeos --disable-replay-opts && \
  --data-dir /opt/eosio/data && \
  --config-dir /opt/eosio/data/config/producer && \
  -c /opt/eosio/data/config/producer/config.ini
```

## Closing Remarks

It's good to get familiar with working with nodeos and for most development purposes you will only need to start / stop the `nodeos` process to set / clear contracts. Otherwise, nodeos is a powerful tool used for synchronizing block producers and quickly setting up your very own test network.

# Getting Access

You need to be a registered developer to get access to Ultra’s Game Developer Center.

1.   Download the [Ultra web installer](https://ultra.io/download)
2.   Register your Ultra account.
3.   Submit your Ultra Developer application:
      1. Gather any relevant docs and info: Email address, Company information, and anything else you consider relevant.
      2. Send it all by email to [partnerships@ultra.io](mailto:partnerships@ultra.io)

Once we validate your application you will receive a confirmation email. When this happens, you should close Ultra if it was open and restart it.

A new dimension should now be displayed, which will contain a series of apps including Ultra’s Game Developer Center (GDC)
![image](https://github.com/Tomas-Cucit/docs-blockchain/assets/140004349/4c5b27fb-fd93-4213-a2d0-1e4ab537d94c)
> A View of the developer dimension containing the GDC app

## Managing your company

When your application is reviewed and approved, a company account will be created for you. Any number of games and members can be under the same company.

On the topic of members, there are three separate roles for them:

-   Company owner: it has total control over both games and other members of the same company. Its permissions can't be changed by other members. At the moment, it can't be changed.
-   Company admin: it has the same level of control as the company owner, but it can be demoted or removed by the owner.
-   Company member: it can create and make changes to game pages, but it can't publish them.

To add someone to your company, follow these steps:

1.   Ask the future member to register an Ultra account
2.   Open the client and access the GDC from an owner or admin account
3.   Navigate to the Company Members section and click on "Add a user"
5.   Enter the user's email address. If you wish to add several people at once, simply click on "Add User Email" as many times as necessary.
7.   Press "Add Users to the Company"

# Declaring a Game

Game developers often have more than one game under their belt and for that reason, we organised Ultra’s GDC in such a way that each game has its own “publishing environment” where you conveniently can set everything related to that particular game such as:

-   The game's store page
-   Game file management
-   Game uniq factories
-   Game SDK functionalities

![image](https://github.com/Tomas-Cucit/docs-blockchain/assets/140004349/53a475ee-3f4c-48ee-bd47-8893b5cd18a3)
> A View of the Game Dev Center

Declaring a new game is as easy as pressing the 'Create a new game' button and giving it a name. However, don’t worry, your game won’t be visible to the public unless you publish your game store page.

## Filling out the Store Page

Before you are able to make your game visible to end-users, you will need to at least publish the store page. In order to do this, all of the necessary details and assets required **must** be filled out. If anything that is required is missing, you will not be able to publish the game store page.

As the Store Page and it's sub-sections are self-explanatory, we will not go into detail about them, however, there are a few points that are worth pointing out:

-   You can preview how your game's store page will look once published at any time, even if the page is not finished yet. Simply click on "Preview" on the bottom left corner.
-   All of the details and assets under this section can be editted even after the page has been published.
-   When the page is already published, any new changes need to be saved and then published. **Just saving a change won't make it visible to users**.
-   Youtube links need to be a full length URL, i.e., `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXXXXXXX` and not `https://youtu.be/XXXXXXXXX`

title: 'File Repositories'

order: 5
---

# Overview

Files repositories will contain your game files for any product you wish to ship to users. You can create different types of file repositories in which you can upload different types of files from your game. such as Core game files, DLC files, Language pack files, etc. Every time a file repository is created, a unique Repository ID is automatically assigned to it. Repository IDs are used for filebeam to identify where to send the files you're uploading.

Every time you create a repository, Ultra will automatically assign it a repository ID, which looks like this: WINCOREG91a7f553-5dd7-4078-813d-b5064629d527. In addition, whenever you upload files to a repository, Ultra will create a new version of that repository while keeping the old one.

Ultra’s versioned repositories are what will enable you to:

1.  Easily apply updates to your customer's files.
2.  Roll back to a previous version if there are issues with your latest build
3.  Operate multiple builds simultaneously through branching. For example, operate a Beta branch and a Master Branch of the same product simultaneously.

## Creating Files Repositories

1.  Go to the GDC and access your game,
2.  In the left menu, go in File Management → File Repository section
3.  Click on **“CREATE NEW WINDOWS FILES REPOSITORY”**

![Untitled](https://github.com/Tomas-Cucit/docs-blockchain/assets/140004349/426f0c53-9c76-4fa2-9025-b79acf2c2b4e)

4.  After clicking on “CREATE NEW WINDOWS FILES REPOSITORY”, a window will show up, where a drop down menu will allow you to choose what type of repository you want to create:
![image](https://github.com/Tomas-Cucit/docs-blockchain/assets/140004349/ad2adf2c-41dd-4ef8-a02f-21933490b7ac)
![image](https://github.com/Tomas-Cucit/docs-blockchain/assets/140004349/e6529d5d-a3aa-4b2e-bebf-abc63365f123)
5.  Select **Game: Game Core Game Files**
6.  Fill in the field to give this repository an internal repository name.
7.  Press **Create Files Repository**
8.  Repeat this but this time let’s make 1 DLC repositories and 2 language packs repositories. When you are done, it should look similar to this:

![image](https://github.com/Tomas-Cucit/docs-blockchain/assets/140004349/6f381b09-63d0-4316-841a-a2260d69eaca)
> A list of repositories of a game. Notice at this point there are 0 versions everywhere because we have not uploaded anything in them.

### Pro Tips:

Ultra’s distribution technology has been built to support cross platform publishing. Future updates will include MacOS and Linux support. In the meantime you can already use cross platform repositories. Cross platform repositories can be used to store platform-independent files such as mp3, PNGs, etc. They are convenient for Language packs or DLCs you’d upload only one time and are usable on all platforms. For the sake of simplicity, in this tutorial we will assume your game only works on windows and will only create windows repositories as a result.

You need at least one Core Game Files repository to assemble and publish a game build.

Internal repository names are for internal use only, they will never be visible to the public. We recommend you to choose distinct names to help you later remember what kind of files it contains. Examples:
-   Standard files
-   Standard with mods
-   Censored files
-   Chinese version
-   Compiling server 2 output
-   Light build
-   Paris office
-   ...

We are now ready to upload your game files!

title: 'Filebeam'

order: 5
---

# Overview

FileBeam is a Python application that lets you upload your games files in appropriate repositories.

New repository versions are only created when one or more new files you uploaded in them have changed. In other words if your language pack or if your DLC files haven’t changed, no new repository versions will be created.

## Quick setup

### Setting up the SSN upload

1. Copy the repository ID that you want to use by clicking on the copy icon.
2. Create a .json (the name isn’t relevant, but we will refer to it as repo_config.json) file with the following structure:

```
[
    {
        "repositoryName": "WINCOREGf7c6c76f-d9c7-4056-8563-xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "source": "C:/UltraGames/YourGame/"
    }
]
```
3. Replace the repositoryName with the repository ID you copied earlier and the source path with the path to the folder containing the content you wish to upload.

Pro tips:

> Pay attention to these details, otherwise, the upload will fail.
> -   Make sure to have an executable file.
> -   Use only forward slashes in the file path.
> -   Include a slash at the end of the file path, before the quotation marks.
> -   Include a comma at the end of each line if the next line also has text.
> -   If you’re uploading to several repositories at once, include a comma after the closing curly bracket of each repository, except after the last repository.

### Getting filebeam

The dependencies necessary to upload files to a repository can be found below, separated by environment:

- [Dev](https://download.dev.app.ultra.io/downloads-dev-ultraio/dev/solid-state-networks/direct6/6.0.0/archive.zip)
- [QA](https://download.qa.app.ultra.io/downloads-dev-ultraio/qa/solid-state-networks/direct6/6.0.0/archive.zip)
- [Preprod](https://download-cdn.preprod.app.ultra.io/solid-state-networks/direct6/6.0.0/archive.zip)
- [Sandbox](https://download.staging.app.ultra.io/downloads-staging-ultraio/solid-state-networks/direct6/6.0.0/archive.zip)
- [Production](https://download-cdn.app.ultra.io/solid-state-networks/direct6/6.0.0/archive.zip)


### Running filebeam

To do this, you need to use an account that is either the company owner or has Admin permissions within the company. Other accounts will see an error message when trying to execute the filebeam script.

1. On the CMD tool of your choice, navigate to the following folder within the downloaded archive:
```
cd {download_location}\sdk-direct6\DIRECT6\deploy\
```
2. Then run this command to start the upload:
```
..\..\setup\python38\python.exe filebeam.py --email=your_account@email.com --repositories_config={file_location}\repo_config.json
```
3. Enter your password, which won't be visible.
![image](https://github.com/Tomas-Cucit/docs-blockchain/assets/140004349/a42efda0-3584-440a-ad05-ac560d9b3ab3)
    -   If your game's executables haven't been signed and protected with Ultra's DRM, you will be prompted to define if the repository should be flagged as protected or unprotected.
        -   If your game is F2P and doesn't require any DRM protection, you can mark it as unprotected.
        -   If your game is paid and it hasn't been signed, please contact [developers@ultra.io](mailto:developers@ultra.io) for assistance.
5. Wait for the upload to complete, then refresh the page in the GDC. A new version of the repository should be added, and you can verify that IDs are identical.
![image](https://github.com/Tomas-Cucit/docs-blockchain/assets/140004349/8af2be15-bd14-4350-a2c4-8a77ad59a39c)

Congratulations, your first file has been uploaded on Ultra!

## Detailed configuration

### Creating the repositories_config.json file

The repositories_config.json (name can be changed) file is used to list all the repositories to deploy with their sources and their filters.

-   repositoryName: the repository name to deploy. This field is **required**
-   source: the path to the content of the repository to deploy. This field is **required**
-   exclude: folders and files to exclude during deployment. This field is **optional**
-   include: folders and files to include during deployment. This field is **optional**

```
[
    {
        "repositoryName": "WINCOREGbc2d6283-f9f5-4be8-840a-7ea46c156760",
        "source": "C:/tools/DIRECT6/samples/source/",
        "exclude": "subfolder/*;!subfolder/test.txt"
    },
    {
        "repositoryName": "WINDLC2d6ca298-dd0d-48f9-bfc7-6ee54c6d6003",
        "source": "C:/tools/DIRECT6/samples/source_dcl1/",
        "include": "subfolder*;!*.txt"
    },
    {
        "repositoryName": "WINDLC61949bbf-b7a6-4a99-a4aa-a3cf81b96aa0",
        "source": "C:/tools/DIRECT6/samples/source_dcl2/"
    }
]
```

### Configuring Exclude and Include Filters

This functionality allows you to deploy a specified set of files and folders from a source directory containing a larger set of files or, on the contrary, exclude a set of files.

Arguments and Information:
-   Wildcard character: *
-   Wildcard negation character: !
-   Files and folders are separated by a semicolon: ;
-   Path to files and folders are relative to the specified source path
-   In case of a conflict, files in the exclude filter will override those in the in include filter

The script filebeam.py relies on the Solid State Networks Direct 6 SDK to deploy on the Ultra platform. This SDK does NOT scan through
your entire source paths in search of all the files that you have included or excluded in your filter list, therefore they will not display an error
when files or folders are missing. The missing files or folders will be ignored so deployment continues uninterrupted by incorrect filters.

### Examples

**Exclude Folder Sample**

This filter will exclude the languages directory, but include every other file and folder
```
exclude=languages/*
```

#### Exclude All Files in Folder Except for One Specified File

This filter will exclude all files in the languages directory except for en-us.json.
```
exclude=languages/*;!languages/en-us.json
```

#### Include only files with a specific extension

This filter will include ONLY files that end with the .jpg extension, regardless of which folder they are found in
Include Specified Folders and a Specifed Filename Format
```
include=*.jpg
```

#### Include Specified Folders and a Specifed Filename Format

This filter will include ONLY the named folders, and files whose name begin with "file"
```
include="dedicated server/*;dlc/*;file*"
```

#### Include Specified Folder but Exclude a Specified Subdirectory of that Folder

This filter will include the named folder, its files and subdirectories except for the the "gotham" subdirectory
```
include=dlc/* --exclude=dlc/gotham/*
```
Another method for accomplishing the same filter using wildcard negation:
```
include=dlc/*;!dlc/gotham/*
```

### Checking Filter Output

To check the contents of the files in your release and whether your filters worked the way you expected them to, open the metafile associated with your release. A copy of the last metafile created is stored under %HOMEPATH%\AppData\Local\Ultra\sdkdirect6\metafiles\repositoryName. In this example the repositoryName=llama-game o we will get the meatfile.json under %HOMEPATH%\AppData\Local\Ultra\sdk-direct6\metafiles\llama-game

### Executing Filebeam

| Parameter | Type/Usage | Description |
| ---- | ---- | :----: |
| email  | string  | email of the ultra user |
| repositories_config | path | Path to the repositories configuration file |
| --cicd | boolean | If added, automatically set to true. The script will get the password of the ultra user directly in the file ultra_auth.json. Convenient for CICD pipeline. Cannot be used if your otp device is active |
| --drm | boolean | If added, automatically set to true. Then the script will get the password of the ultra user directly in the file ultra_auth.json. Convenient for CICD pipeline. Cannot be used if your otp device is active |

title: 'Game Builds'

order: 6

# Overview

Game builds can be a combination of one or more repositories containing files. In other words, the process to manage the files your users will need is:
Create repositories => Upload files to repositories => Assemble a build using the repositories

Ultra lets you create different types of file repositories in which you’ll upload different parts of your game files:

-   **Core game files:** Contains the game executable and most of the game files.
-   **Game DLC:** additional content you want to distribute separately such as new maps, skins, music, etc.
-   **Core demo game files:** Contains all the files necessary to download and play a demo of your game.
-   **Game language packs:** files related to a specific language such as sounds, movies and textures you believe is unnecessary to send to users who don’t talk the language **(Coming soon).**
-   **Game dedicated server:** Files necessary to run a dedicated server of your game. This allows anyone, even if they don’t own the game, to download and run a dedicated server **(Coming soon).**

## Assembling a Game Build

In order to assemble any kind of build, you will first need to have created a repository of the corresponding type, and uploaded files to it.

Before we can assemble a game build version, we first need to create a game build.

1.  Click on Create new game build
2.  Select the OS you want your game built on (**Linux and MacOS support planned**)
3.  Set the Internal Game build name.
4.  Select a repository and one of its versions.
   
![image](https://github.com/Tomas-Cucit/docs-blockchain/assets/140004349/41ff1220-eb33-4836-9d03-777f2685134d)

7.  Specify the executable file to run the game, whether it’s for 32 bits, 64 bits, or both.
   
![image](https://github.com/Tomas-Cucit/docs-blockchain/assets/140004349/27ec3e43-ad69-4295-81ec-0cb22874c2e5)

10.  If there are additional sets of files, such as DLCs, you can select which of them should be compatible with the build you're assemnbling.
11.  Create the game build.
    
![image](https://github.com/Tomas-Cucit/docs-blockchain/assets/140004349/17e5de82-fdb5-4c50-93a0-ec74666fc4e1)

Now you should be done with assembling the game build, you can determine whether this build version is a **Master** branch (intended for public release) or **Beta** branch (as mentioned before, this is still not available).

Congratulations! Your build is now created and ready to be delivered to users.

### Important things to know

-   Whenever you run Filebeam and upload files, the repositories receiving files will have their repository version number incremented. At the same time, whenever you assemble a new version of your game build, its version number will increase. **These increments are not linked**, as illustrated in the following image
![image](https://github.com/Tomas-Cucit/docs-blockchain/assets/140004349/68b10868-c627-41c2-923c-fc730196c647)

-   On the topic of branches, below is an example of how they might be used. On the left, the build V1 is promoted as master branch of My Game Standard Edition, on the right the build V2 is promoted to the master branch. **Beta branches coming Soon**
![image](https://github.com/Tomas-Cucit/docs-blockchain/assets/140004349/65dc8046-910f-4be6-bd87-f8af2411644c)

-   Following the example above, as soon as build V2 is promoted as the master branch, all users who had V1 installed will see an update button on their library and will not be able to launch it until it's updated. In addition, anyone who installs the game will directly get V2 files from here on.

-   Including a DLC repository in a build doesn’t mean the buyer of the game will receive this DLC. It only means the files contained in the DLC repository version you associated with this build are compatible with it. The buyer will still have to separately buy the DLC to get it, and when they buy it, Ultra’s file distribution system will know what DLC repository version to download for this particular game build version.

-   In the future you’ll be able to “bundle” DLCs tokens with Game tokens, allowing you to sell your game containing DLCs. In the meantime, if you want gamers to get DLCs as part of the game they buy, upload DLC files in your core game files repository.

-   When you include a Language pack version in a build, the buyer of this build will have the ability to download it if they wish. If you want to separately sell a language pack you need to upload the language pack in a DLC repository and sell it as a DLC.

# Game Uniq Factories

## Overview

The Uniq factory is the place where you will mint your game as an item (Uniq) in the Ultra ecosystem. You will be able to set all your commercial requirements and uniq rules into the Store Token Factory, like setting a game for internal usage or to organize a restricted close beta (both planned). Every uniq factory and uniq will be represented in our platform through a uniq ID card, which will contain all uniq functionalities and is contextualized all over the platform.

Additionally, this is where you will set all the rules for your game lifecycle. Once done, everyone who buys from this factory will receive a token bound by these rules. Currently, our uniq factories are only able to create an atomic token.

### Uniqs / Tokens

A uniq is an immutable unit of your content, it follows the rules set of the emitting uniq factory. This uniq will give access to the content that its linked repository contains. Uniq factories have a real numeric version of your retail game, which provides you more features and more control on your side. Additionally, there are different types of uniq factories such as Game, Demo, DLC, etc…

The following is the lifecycle statuses of a uniq factory:
-   Draft
-   Ready to publish
-   Published
-   Expired (not available yet)
-   Unpublished (not available yet)
-   Disabled

**Atomic token**: A type of uniq that will give specific content access defined by the selected branch to a player. This is only the first type of token but we are planning to add more in the future to give you more flexibility and open new business opportunities.

**Game package**: A single uniq that gives a user access to a game's contents (Example: Game with DLC on a single token). Bundles and packs that can be sold together as uniqs this way.

## Uniq Factories

You are currently able to create games, demos, and DLC uniqs that have their own preset rules.

-   Games: You can freely configure your game without restriction.
-   DLC: You can freely configure your game without restriction.
-   DEMO: Not available yet.
-   Language pack: Not available yet.
-   Dedicated server: Not available yet.

Reminder: To create a uniq factory you should have published an assembly build first, then linked it to the token factory.

### Creating a "Store token factory"

Click on “Create a new token factory”

![image](https://github.com/Tomas-Cucit/docs-blockchain/assets/140004349/3a2a5480-ad1b-4bbe-bbc1-e059ca792a7f)

-   This name will be visible to end users
-   You can start your factory from scratch or you can create a factory from an existing one to copy its settings, which you can then edit.

![image](https://github.com/Tomas-Cucit/docs-blockchain/assets/140004349/136a6a6f-e7cb-4450-a04a-e8509169e45a)

-   If you are starting from scratch then you need to choose the type of uniq you want to use.
-   Click on "Create" to start the creation of your uniq.
-   Congratulations, at this point your uniq factory is now created (although not published), you can come back to finish it later.

![image](https://github.com/Tomas-Cucit/docs-blockchain/assets/140004349/667e3444-fb9e-43ec-850e-aff0c10f93d3)

#### Configure the Store token factory

-   If you left your uniq factory in an incomplete state, you can retrieve it from the list and continue setting it up by clicking on "Edit Factory"

![image](https://github.com/Tomas-Cucit/docs-blockchain/assets/140004349/113ff0f5-028a-448a-bd00-f13c7698043a)

-   The starting "Main Information" page holds following details:
    -   Token name, which should represent the version of your uniq. For example: Standard Edition, GOTY edition, etc.
    -   A short description (only one language localization is available).
    -   A small picture which will be the representation of the content in the platform.
    -   The image used in the background of your uniq id card.
    -   The default language contained in this uniq.
    -   Note: this section is not editable once published.

![image](https://github.com/Tomas-Cucit/docs-blockchain/assets/140004349/a9812a97-df3a-4d12-bd17-076bf9522b6b)

-   Within the "Type & Content" section, you will be able to change the type of uniq factory you're creating, as well as link the game build you want to provide access to.
    -   Only the published game builds are displayed here.
    -   Note: this section is not editable once published.

![image](https://github.com/Tomas-Cucit/docs-blockchain/assets/140004349/20402ad9-a87f-461b-8a5a-d0fa979968b7)

-   The "Geofencing" section allows you to set in what regions your uniq factory will be available, based on the user location upon registreting.
    -   This allows you to select the entire world, or specific countries/regions that you want your content to be available for users to view, buy and play.
    -   Selecting countries is fully customizable. Users located within an unavailable area will not be able to view the content in the store (although the game page itself will still be visible).
    -   Note: this section is not editable once published.

-   The "Price & Revenue Shares" section offers different options based on the main choice between **paid** and **free** content.
    -   If the uniq is set as paid, you will need to set a price in all of the available currencies.
        -   In order to exclude a currency, the corresponding countries and regions linked to it must be excluded in the Geofencing section.
        -   In addition, you need to select the revenue share distribution. Ultra always takes a 15% commission, and it is up to you to distribute the remaining 85%. At the moment, promoters cannot be configured.
    -   If you set the uniq as free there are no other settings on this page.

-   Skipping the "Tradability & Transferability" section, we will move on to "**Media**". In this section, you can put up to 8 pictures to advertise your uniq so your content will be more appealing in the store and across the whole ultra platform.

### The Store Token Factory and true uniq factories

One of Ultra's objectives is offering game ownership to users through the use of blockchain technology. We achieve this by tokenizing games, i.e., linking every game or piece of content you want to offer to a uniq that exists on our blockchain and acts as proof of ownership of its corresponding content.

At the moment, publishing a game with it's store token factory doesn't mean that the game is truly tokenized yet. The real uniq factory that will be present in our blockchain needs to be created separately through a process currently managed by Ultra employees. As we continue opening up our ecosystem, we hope to allow third parties to self-manage this.

#### Tradability and resellability

Although what you set up on this section within the GDC doesn't affect the uniq factory's real settings, it's still necessary to establish some of its related concepts.
-   **Tradable** means your token can be sold by end-users that hold it and will appear in the secondhand market.
-   **Transferable** means that your token can be transferred from one wallet to another, with no cost to it.
-   **Non tradable** means that your token cannot be set on sale by end-users, and consequently cannot appear in the secondhand market.
-   **Non transferable** means that your token cannot be sent freely by users .

Notes:
-   A game can be tradable and not transferable, and the other way around.
-   You can set a minimum resale price to prevent your game from being sold under a certain price. This can be set both in USD and UOS.
-   You can set the revenue share to be earned from the second hand market. The options are to set a fixed price or a % of the selling price set by the customer. Note: To set a fixed amount you need to choose a minimum resale price
-   You can set tradability and transferability windows. If set, they will define when your token can be traded/transferred.

### Finishing up

Even if you didn't finish the uniq factory yet, the "Preview" option should be available at all times. This allows you to view what the factory will look like in Ultra.

If you did fill all of the necessary details... Congratulations! Your uniq factory should now ready to be published.

# Game Developer Center

The Game Development Center (or GDC for short) is where everything involved in the set up and publication of your games' store pages can be found. Whether it's adding the assets to display on the store, uploading your games' files, integrating our Unity or Unreal plugin, all will take place on the GDC.

## Overview

Before we start with a step by step guide on how to upload your game on Ultra, we will start with a high level overview of Ultra’s unique product distribution technology. Unlike other game distribution platforms, on Ultra, product ownership is represented on the blockchain.

Other platforms work like this:
User buys a product => Company stores the ownership variable on a database => Product shows up in the user's library

On Ultra, the ownership entitlement looks like this:
User buys product => Product's token is added to the user's wallet (which is their blockchain account) => Product shows up in user’s library. In other words, product entitlements are stored on the blockchain instead of a classic database.

By setting up a store token factory in Ultra’s GDC (no coding required), you can associate a game build branch to any uniq this uniq factory produces. Do note that at the moment, the uniq factory needs to be created by Ultra employees in order for it to be on our blockchain. More information can be found on the "Uniq Factories" section of this guide.

# Getting Started with Integrating Ultra

First, we must define what type of app you have and what tech stack you are using. With this information, we can help guide you as to what type of integration you'll need to successfully integrate into Ultra's ecosystem.

## Are you web-based?

If your app is web-based, next you will need to decide whether or not you need verified user identification. This boils down to whether you need to know if the user who has connected to your app is who he says he is, or whether him being able to sign a transaction is enough.

For any app that is not embedded in the Ultra client directly, it is sufficient to simply allow users to sign transactions. A good example of an app that requires user verification is Ultra Arena, which is deeply integrated into Ultra's ecosystem.

-   If your app is deeply integrated into Ultra's ecosystem, you must follow our [Ultra SSO integration guide](./web/index.md).
-   If your app is a web-based app that a user will connect to via their browser, you should follow our [Wallet Extension guide](../products/ultra-wallet/index.md).

## Are you building with Unity?

If you're building with Unity, we have a set of helpful examples and a plugin which will help you get started. You should check our [Ultra Unity integration guide](./unity/index.md) which houses the details for where to get the Unity plugin, and how to use it.

## Are you building with Unreal?

If you're building with Unreal, we have a set of helpful examples and a plugin which will help you get started. You should check our [Ultra Unreal Subsystem integration guide](./unreal/index.md) which houses the details for where to get the Unreal Subsystem, and how to use it.

Many developers use Epic's Online Service for multiplayer so that they can unify their player base across all deployments. We have put [together a document](./web/index.md) that specifies exactly how to do that so that your game can connect Ultra's users to those of other platforms.

We currently do not have a subsystem that you can use to connect to the Ultra client.

# Getting the Ultra Unity Plugin

To connect the Ultra client to your Unity-based game, you must use our Unity plugin. The plugin passes the user's wallet id and an auth token into Unity from Ultra's client. This is used to connect to Braincloud's SDK and authenticate.

Before you get started, please make sure to get your [client_id](../web/get-client-id.md), as you'll need this to be able to use the Ultra Unity Plugin.

## Getting the Ultra Unity Plugin

We provide access to the Ultra Unity plugin via a public repository.

[Download the Unity plugin here](https://github.com/ultraio/unity-auth-plugin)

## Installing the Ultra Unity Plugin

The Ultra Unity Plugin is based on UPM (Unity Package Manager). As of now it's not published to any registry so you will have to manually install the package with one of the following approaches:

### With a clone of the repository

-   Open the Package Manager (Window > Package Manager)
-   Click the `+` icon and select `Add package from disk`
-   Select the root folder of the plugin

### With a git URL

-   Open the Package Manager (Window > Package Manager)
-   Click the `+` icon and select `Add Package from git URL`

### Unity Compatibility

The plugin has been created and tested with Unity 2021.

## Example Project

We provide an example project which you can download and explore. It not only uses the Ultra Unity Plugin, but also integrates

[Bombers Example Project](https://github.com/ultraio/unity-bombers)

# Using the Ultra Unity Plugin

Welcome to the Ultra Unity Plugin!
This simple plugin is meant to allow you to leverage from Ultra's ecosystem without breaking your players flow (= seamless in-game authentication).
Once you complete the following the page, your game will be able to:

-   Retrieve players basic information (such as their username) with no user input required.
-   Connect to UltraCloud using the brainCloud SDK, allowing you to access Ultra in-game features.

## Settings

Once the package is installed, open the Ultra Settings window (a new entry should have been added): `Ultra > Settings`

![Ultra Menu](/images/unity_images/ultra_menu.png)

This will open the following editor:

![Ultra Settings](/images/unity_images/ultra_settings.png)

There you need to enter your Ultra `Client Id`. For now, you need to get in contact with the Ultra support to receive your Client Id.

The default `Authentication URL` is the Ultra production authentication server. If you are using a different server, make sure to edit this field.

## Initialization script

### TL;DR

Samples are attached to the package.

There you will find a scene and a sample script showing you how to interact with Ultra.

![Ultra Menu](/images/unity_images/ultra_samples.png)

### Step by Step implementation

If you want the initialization to start on the launch of the game, you could create a `gameObject` in the first scene of your game and attach a new script to it.

In the `Awake` or `Start` method you can then initialze the plugin. Example:

```
void Awake()
{
    DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject); // Only if you wish to use this gameObject as a place to manage Ultra lifecycle in parallel of your game execution
    Ultra.Init();
}
```

Note that you don't need to specify the settings. The `Init()` call will retrieve the configuration made graphically. If you prefer not relying on the settings from the UI, you can instead use `Init(authUrl, clientId)`.

The `Init` function also takes callbacks as parameters so to track failures and successes you should instead do as follow:

```
    Ultra.Init(OnInitSuccess, OnInitFailure);
```

```
void OnInitSuccess(string username, string idToken)
{
    Debug.Log($"{username} is now playing!");
}

void OnInitFailure(UltraError error)
{
    Debug.LogError($"Ultra initialization failed - {error.Message}");
}
```

Note that for the game to retrieve player information, the Ultra Desktop Client has to be running with an active session.

At development time, if you don't use the Ultra desktop application, you could use the browser to authenticate instead.
For this you simply need to activate the browser configuration before intializing the tool.
Example:

```
#if UNITY_EDITOR
    Ultra.UseBrowser = true;
#endif
    Ultra.Init();
```

## Connecting to UltraCloud

As mentioned before, if you wish to connect your game to Ultra gaming ecosystem, you will also have to install our partner brainCloud's SDK which already supports our blockchain features and comes with plenty of additional game tools.

Connecting to UltraCloud means:

-   Installing the brainCloud SDK
-   Configuring it to rely on our Ultra instance
-   Initialzing it programmatically

### Installing brainCloud SDK

You will find the brainCloud SDK and installation steps [here](https://github.com/getbraincloud/braincloud-csharp).
At this stage you only need to install the brainCloud package.
Note that to use the Ultra flavour we need here, you will have to use a specific configuration though.

### UltraCloud configuration

Once the SDK is installed, open the brainCloud Settings page.
![Ultra Menu](/images/unity_images/bc_settings.png)

Here you need to do few changes:

-   Deselect the `Use Default brainCloud Server` option to specify the Ultra production instance in place of the default `Server URL`: `https://api.ultracloud.ultra.io`
-   The `email` here should be from one user with access to UltraCloud Portal(accessible from the Ultra desktop Client)
-   The `password` here should be an API key generated for this given user in the UltraCloud Portal (check the following ).

#### Get your API key

For teams you want to access apps for (using the Unity plugin), a Team-admin must generate an API key in the Ultra Cloud Portal:

Access the UltraCloud Portal:

![Ultra Menu](/images/unity_images/ultracloud_app.png)

-   Enable Builder API access via the Team | Manage | Team Info page

-   Give any devs Builder API permission via the Team | Manage | Members page

-   Finally, the developer needs to create an API key for himself to use. This is a personal key linked to him.

-   Log into the portal in a Team where you have Builder API permission

-   Click in the top-right-hand corner (on the user name), go to the API Keys page - and create a key.

-   Click the [Get] button to retrieve the key, and that same button again to [Copy]

Finally, use that API key retrieved as the password when logging into the user’s account via the brainCloud window in Unity.

Once you are all set, login and select your relevant application information (team + application name)!

### Initialize brainCloud with the Ultra session

Once the configuration is done. You need to initialize the brainCloud library programmatically.

Modify the `OnUltraInitializationSuccess` callback previously created with the following:

```
void OnUltraInitializationSuccess(string username, string idToken)
{
    Debug.Log($"{username} is now playing!");
    SuccessCallback successCallback = (response, cbObject) =>
    {
        Debug.Log("UltraCloud Authentication was successful");
    };
    FailureCallback failureCallback = (status, code, error, cbObject) =>
    {
        Debug.Log($"Failed | {status} {code} {error}");
    };
    var go = new GameObject();
    BrainCloudWrapper _ultracloud = go.AddComponent<BrainCloudWrapper>();
    _ultracloud.Init();
    _ultraCloud.AuthenticateUltra(username, idToken, true, successCallback, failureCallback);
    DontDestroyOnLoad(go);
}
```

Now, your users will be connecting to UltraCloud using their Ultra active sessions. Congratulations!

[Check the BrainCloud documentation to see what you can do with the BrainCloudWrapper instance.](http://getbraincloud.com/apidocs/apiref/#capi)

# Getting the Ultra Unreal Subsystem

To connect the Ultra client to your Unity-based game, you must use our Ultra Unreal Subsystem. The subsystem passes the user's wallet id and an auth token into Unreal from Ultra's client. This is used to connect to Braincloud's SDK and authenticate.

Before you get started, please make sure to get your [client_id](../web/get-client-id.md), as you'll need this to be able to use the Ultra Unity Plugin.

## Getting the Ultra Unreal Subsystem

We provide access to the Ultra Unity plugin via a public repository.

[Download the Ultra Unreal Subsystem here](https://github.com/ultraio/UltraUnrealOnlineSubsystem)

## Installing the Ultra Unreal Subsystem

The Ultra Unreal Subsystem is not published to any registry so you will have to manually install the package:

-   Clone the Repository
-   Add the plugin to your project YourProjectName/Plugins/OnlineSubsystemUltra
-   Start Unreal Editor
-   Go to Edit / Plugins
-   Search OnlineSubsystemUltra
-   Enable the plugin

# Using the Ultra Unreal Subsystem

## Example Project

We've put together an example project which illustrates the expected flow. You can grab the [example project here](https://github.com/ultraio/UnrealSampleProject).

## Access

You'll need a `client_id` for this. To get one, [you can request one directly from Ultra](https://developers.ultra.io/guides/Integrating%20Ultra/requesting-a-client_id.html).

## Configuration

To configure Ultra's Unreal Online Subsystem, you need to edit the DefaultEngine.ini:

```ini
[OnlineSubsystem]
DefaultPlatformService=Ultra ; Set OnlineSubsystemUltra as default online subsystem

[OnlineSubsystemUltra]
bEnabled=true
; Authentication
ClientId="XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX" ; Mandatory - The Client Id given by Ultra
DispatcherUrl="https://api.ultracloud.ultra.io/dispatcherv2" ; Optional - The dispatcher URL (default: https://api.ultracloud.ultra.io/dispatcherv2)
AuthenticationUrl="https://auth.ultra.io/auth/realms/ultraio/protocol/openid-connect" ; Optional - The openid authentication URL (default: https://auth.ultra.io/auth/realms/ultraio/protocol/openid-connect)
bUseBrowser=false ; Optional - If true, the browser will be launched to prompt the user credentials otherwise the 'ApplicationProtocol' will be used to handle the login (default: false)
ApplicationProtocol=ultra ; Optional - If set to "ultra", the Ultra launcher will be called to login the user (default: ultra)
```

## Authentication

```
const IOnlineIdentityPtr IdentityInterface = Online->GetIdentityInterface();
FDelegateHandle Handle;
IdentityInterface->AddOnLoginCompleteDelegate_Handle(UserIndex, FOnLoginCompleteDelegate::CreateLambda([IdentityInterface, Handle](int32 LocalUserNum, bool Success, const FUniqueNetId& UserId, const FString& Error)
{
  IdentityInterface->ClearOnLoginCompleteDelegate_Handle(LocalUserNum, Handle);
  FString Nickname = IdentityInterface->GetPlayerNickname(LocalUserNum);
  // do something
}));
IdentityInterface->AutoLogin(UserIndex);
```

# Requesting a client_id

Ultra's authentication servers, both for their staging and their production environments, are protected by Keycloak.

To access them, you'll require a `client_id`. This can be requested directly from [developers@ultra.io](mailto:developers@ultra.io).

Without this you will not be able to use the Unity plugin, integrate into Epic's Online Service for multiplayer, or integrate your app directly into Ultra's client.

title: 'Ultra SSO integration guide'

outline: [0, 5]
order: 1
---

# Ultra SSO integration guide

The ultra platform Identity and Access Management (IAM) is provided by an OpenID Connect compliant server.

The ultra platform OpenID Connect server is Keycloak. Each development partner must [request a client_id](./get-client-id.md) from Ultra.

OpenID Connect is an interoperable authentication protocol based on the OAuth 2.0 family of specifications.

## Requesting access from Ultra

Before being able to successfully start this tutorial, you will need to send a client request to the Ultra team to the [support@ultra.io](mailto:support@ultra.io) email address giving:

-   a description of the purpose of the web application
-   a redirect URL which will be used by our auth server to redirect the user when logged in (we will take `https://redirecturi/callback` as example in the tutorial)

Once the [client_id](./get-client-id.md) for your web application has been created by the Ultra team, an email response will be sent back to you with the corresponding client_id (and clientSecret which will be useless for the flow used in the Single Sign On - i.e. SSO).

### Domains

For different domains, Ultra provides different URLs that you must use for authentication purposes. These are the ones that are open to the public.

| Auth Domain           | Blockchain network | Example URL                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| auth.ultra.io         | Mainnet            | https://auth.ultra.io/auth/realms/ultraio/protocol/openid-connect/auth         |
| auth.staging.ultra.io | Testnet            | https://auth.staging.ultra.io/auth/realms/ultraio/protocol/openid-connect/auth |

## Requesting OAuth Authorization Code

### Request

Below is an example of a request URL that you can open in the browser windows (Ultra client) to request an OAuth Authorization Code. Replace the parameter values with the ones relevant to your project.

```sh
https://auth.staging.ultra.io/auth/realms/ultraio/protocol/openid-connect/auth
?client_id=third-party-client
&response_type=code
&state=fj8o3n7bdy1op5
```

In this example, the parts above are:

-   http://auth.staging.ultra.io – is the domain on which our authorization server is running (for production environment staging will need to be replaced by https://auth.ultra.io as described in the openId flows documentation)

-   ultraio – is the Ultra Realm

-   third-party-client – is the OAuth client_id you received from the Ultra team (see the above prerequisite)

-   code – is a response_type (OAuth Response Type). This value must be “code” for the OAuth Code Grant flow to work. If you provide a different value here, the request will not work. The response_type is a required parameter in OAuth Code Grant flow,

-   fj8o3n7bdy1op5 – is a RECOMMENDED, opaque value used by the client to maintain state between the request and callback. You will need to generate this random alphanumeric string of characters and include them in the request. The authorization server includes this value when redirecting the user-agent back to the client. The parameter SHOULD be used for preventing cross-site request forgery. The page that handles the response from the authorization server will need to read this value and compare it to the original one that was sent with this request. The two values must match.

Remember that this parameter should be:

1. Unique per user session.
2. Secret
3. Unpredictable (large random value generated by a secure method. Ex.: java.security.SecureRandom).

### Response

In the case of a successful request, the authorization server will generate the authorization code and will redirect the client application to a Redirect URI configured in our auth server for this OAuth client.

```json
https://redirecturi/callback
?state=fj8o3n7bdy1op5
&session_state=f109bb89-cd34-4374-b084-c3c1cf2c8a0b
&code=0aaca7b5-a314-4c07-8212-818cb4b7e8d0.f109bb89-cd34-4374-b084-c3c1cf2c8a0b.1dc15d06-d8b9-4f0f-a042-727eaa6b98f7
```

## Optional Request Parameters

A request for an authorization code can include other optional parameters:

-   scope – OPTIONAL. The scope of the access request,

-   redirect_uri – OPTIONAL. After completing its interaction with the resource owner, the authorization server directs the resource owner’s user-agent back to the client. The authorization server redirects the user-agent to the client’s redirection endpoint previously established with the authorization server during the client registration process or when making the authorization request. If you include this request parameter in the request, then its value must match the one configured in Ultra authorization server. Otherwise, an error will take place.

Below is a Request URL that contains all required, recommended, and optional request parameters you can use in the request for an OAuth Authorization Code.

```sh
https://auth.staging.ultra.io/auth/realms/ultraio/protocol/openid-connect/auth
?client_id=third-party-client
&response_type=code
&scope=blockchainid
&redirect_uri=https://redirecturi/callback
&state=fj8o3n7bdy1op5
```

## Exchanging Authorization Code for the Id token

Once you have the Authorization Code, you are ready to exchange it for an access token. Below is an example of a curl command you can use to exchange an authorization code for an access token. Replace the request parameter values with the ones relevant to your project.

### Request

```sh
curl --location --request POST 'https://auth.staging.ultra.io/auth/realms/ultraio/protocol/openid-connect/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-urlencode 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
--data-urlencode 'client_id=third-party-client' \
--data-urlencode 'code=0aaca7b5-a314-4c07-8212-818cb4b7e8d0.f109bb89-cd34-4374-b084-c3c1cf2c8a0b.1dc15d06-d8b9-4f0f-a042-727eaa6b98f7' \
--data-urlencode 'redirect_uri=https://redirecturi/callback'
```

Where:

-   https://redirecturi/callback – is a redirect_uri which is REQUIRED, if the redirect_uri parameter was included in the authorization request to acquire the Authorization Code,
-   authorization_code – is a REQUIRED grant_type parameter which value must be “authorization_code”. If you provide a different value here, the request will not be successful.
-   The value of a code request parameter must be an OAuth Authorization Code that was received from an authorization server. It is this value we are exchanging for an access token.

### Response

In case of a successful request, below is an example of a response that contains an idtoken (containing the requested user information / ex: walletId, username, email), an access token and a refresh token.

# Contract Builder Overview

The contract builder allows you to easily build smart contracts in various ways.

You can drag & drop, or use the `cli` directly, or even integrate it as a library into your own tools.

The contract builder comes in three different flavors.

* Library
* Global `cli` application
* Binary File

Each of these are available to download from the main repository.

Usage as a library can be viewed inside of the README in the official repository.

[https://github.com/ultraio/contract-builder](https://github.com/ultraio/contract-builder)

## Supports

* cdt-cpp
* cmake

## Dependencies

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)


## Installing with NodeJS

Keep in mind we use at least Node v16+ for this.

```
npm i -g @ultraos/contract-builder
```

## Obtaining Binary Files

Binaries can be [obtained here](https://github.com/ultraio/contract-builder/releases)

## Usage

If you are on windows, you can drag / drop the folder onto the binary file to compile.

```
contract-builder ./some-folder/some-example-contract-folder
```

### Build Parameters

```sh
contract-builder -i ./test/example-contract -b "-DTEST=true"
```

## Examples

See [https://github.com/ultraio/contract-builder/tree/main/test](https://github.com/ultraio/contract-builder/tree/main/test) for example contracts to utilize with this project.

# API Authentication Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the API Authentication Documentation for Ultra API . This document provides guidelines and instructions for managing authentication when interacting with our API.

## How to register

To access our API endpoints, third-party clients must first obtain appropriate credentials depending on their application type.

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

### Frontend Application Registration

For frontend applications, you need to obtain a registration token and a unique X-Client-ID. These credentials are essential for authenticating requests and identifying clients accessing our API. To request the registration token and X-Client-ID, please contact our support team at developers@ultra.io. They will guide you through the registration process and provide you with the necessary credentials to integrate with our API securely.

### Backend Application Registration

For backend applications, you'll need a client ID and a client secret. To set up authentication for your backend application, you must implement a client credentials flow. This integration enables your backend application to authenticate users through another backend securely. Please contact our support team at developers@ultra.io. They will guide you through the registration process and provide you with the necessary credentials to integrate with our API securely.

## Authentication Flow

The authentication flow for the Ultra API depends on the type of application.

### Frontend Application Authentication Flow

When making requests to API endpoints from a frontend application, follow these steps:

-   Obtain Registration Token: Upon registration, users receive a unique registration token and X-Client-ID associated with their account.

-   Authentication Header: Include the registration token as the authentication bearer in the request header when making API requests. Use the Authorization: Bearer {registration_token} header.

-   Client Identification: Along with the registration token, clients must include their X-Client-ID parameter in the request header to identify themselves to the API.

### Backend Application Authentication Flow

For backend applications, follow these steps:

-   Obtain Client Credentials: Upon registration, obtain a client ID and client secret for your backend application.

-   Configure Backend Application: Configure your backend application for authentication. This typically involves setting up appropriate middleware or libraries to handle authentication using the client ID and client secret.

-   Implement Client Credentials Flow : Implement the authentication flow in your backend application according to the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect specifications. Ensure that your backend application follows best practices for securely handling authentication tokens and user sessions.

## Examples

### Endpoints :

```yaml
# Sandbox:
https://staging.api.ultra.io/graphql
# Production:
https://api.ultra.io/graphql
```

### Login Example Frontend Application (cURL)

```bash
# Frontend Application
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {registration_token}" \
  -H "X-Client-ID: YourClientID" \
  https://api.example.com/your-endpoint
```

### Login Example Backend Application (cURL)

```bash
# Backend Application
curl -X POST \
  -H "client_id:YourClientID" \
  -H "client_secret: YourClientSecret" \
  -H "grant_type: client_credentials" \
  -H "scope: YourScope" \
  https://api.example.com/your-endpoint
```

## Error Handling

-   **Invalid Credentials**: When logging in with incorrect registration_token or X-Client-ID, the API responds with 401 Unauthorized.
-   **Unauthorized Access**: When accessing protected endpoints without a valid token, the API responds with 401 Unauthorized.

## Appendix

# Errors

This section is dedicated to providing our users with comprehensive insights into our error handling mechanisms.

## GraphQL errors

GraphQL errors encompass issues arising from server-side execution of GraphQL operations, including:

-   Syntax Errors: These occur when a query is not correctly formed.
-   Validation Errors: These happen when a query references a schema field that does not exist.
-   Resolver Errors: These are encountered when an error occurs as the server attempts to fetch data for a query field.

In cases of syntax or validation errors, the server will not execute the operation because it is deemed invalid. However, if resolver errors are encountered, the server may still return partial data alongside the errors.

Below is an example of an error message returned following a validation error:

```json
{
    "data": null,
    "errors": [
        {
            "message": {
                "statusCode": {
                    "value": 400
                },
                "message": "Cannot query field \"nonexistentField\" on type \"Query\"."
            },
            "path": ["exampleOfPath"],
            "locations": [
                {
                    "line": {
                        "value": 2
                    },
                    "column": {
                        "value": 3
                    }
                }
            ],
            "extensions": {
                "response": {
                    "statusCode": {
                        "value": 400
                    },
                    "message": "Cannot query field \"nonexistentField\" on type \"Query\"."
                },
                "exception": {
                    "response": {
                        "statusCode": {
                            "value": 400
                        },
                        "message": "Cannot query field \"nonexistentField\" on type \"Query\"."
                    },
                    "status": {
                        "value": 400
                    },
                    "options": {},
                    "message": "Cannot query field \"nonexistentField\" on type \"Query\".",
                    "name": "GraphQlValidationException",
                    "stacktrace": [
                        "GraphQLError: Cannot query field \"nonexistentField\" on type \"Query\".",
                        "...additional lines..."
                    ]
                },
                "code": "GRAPHQL_VALIDATION_FAILED",
                "statusCode": {
                    "value": 400
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Network errors

Network errors refer to problems encountered during communication with the GraphQL server, typically leading to a response status code in the 4xx or 5xx range, indicating an unsuccessful attempt and resulting in no data being returned.

## GraphQL over WebSocket

When using WebSocket, you can get errors with the code `4401` in the following situations:
- Your access token is invalid.
- Your refresh token is invalid.
- Missing ping message with a valid refreshed access token before the current access token expiration.
- Reaching the limit of WebSocket connections per user.

# Introduction

Ultra is excited to offer external developers enhanced access to on-chain data through an easily consumable package, designed to streamline the integration process within their applications.

Leveraging the power of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), the Ultra API adopts a schema-driven approach, making data more accessible and developer-friendly.

Resources provided include:

-   [Authentication](./authentication.md)
-   [Errors](./errors.md)
-   [Queries](./queries.md)
-   [Subscriptions](./subscriptions.md)
-   [Types](./types.md)

## Purpose of the Ultra API

Accessing up-to-date, specific data within our ecosystem can be challenging. This includes information on Uniq Factories, the Uniqs they produce, and associated metadata—all vital components that are traditionally difficult to retrieve.

The Ultra API simplifies the integration and manipulation of NFT data for developers.

## Capabilities Offered by the Ultra API

Focused on NFT data, the Ultra API facilitates a variety of tasks, making the following operations straightforward:

-   Retrieving a complete list of Uniq Factory IDs
-   Fetching details for a specific Uniq Factory using its ID
-   Accessing a particular Uniq with its ID
-   Identifying a Uniq Factory associated with a given Uniq ID
-   Listing Uniqs linked to a wallet ID
-   Extracting Uniq Factory Metadata and/or Media Content by ID, including images, descriptions, and more
-   Determining the type of a Uniq (e.g., collectible, game) via its ID

Additionally, it enables access to marketplace-specific information such as resale status, revenue splits, and metadata conditions.

## Using the Ultra API

Developers need a `client_id` to interact with the Ultra API's endpoints. For access, please send a request to [developers@ultra.io](mailto:developers@ultra.io).

#### Example

##### Query

``` js
query UniqBuyOfferConfig {
  uniqBuyOfferConfig {
    maxActiveOfferPerUser
    maxDuration
    minDuration
    minPrice {
      amount
      currency {

## `uniqBuyOffers`

##### Description

Simplifies the process of finding offers based on the factory, uniq, or
buyer. This functionality is designed to include offers that are no
longer valid, enabling the retrieval of any offer, whether expired or if
the associated uniq has been burned. Please note that this query won't
return the factory offer for each uniq it applies to, as factory offers
don't have a uniq attached. If you prefer to see valid factory offer for
each uniq it applies to, you should utilize the "uniqEffectiveBuyOffers"
query instead.

##### Response

Returns a [`UniqBuyOfferList!`](types.md#uniqbuyofferlist)

## `uniqEffectiveBuyOffers`

##### Description

Enables the retrieval of effective offers. This feature provides active
offers for a specified uniq, factory, buyer, or owner. By default, this
query returns offers for each uniq it applies to, including those made
on both the uniq and uniq factory sides, unless a specific filter is
applied. Note: An active offer means the offer is not expired, and the
associated uniq is not burned.

##### Response

Returns a
[`UniqEffectiveBuyOfferList!`](types.md#uniqeffectivebuyofferlist)

# Release notes

We're thrilled to announce the release of a new version of the Ultra API. This update focuses on enhancing user experience, increasing performance, and introducing new functionalities to make integration even more seamless.

## Release 0.3.0

### Key Highlights

-   Changing `uniqEffectiveBuyOffers`, subject filter to mandatory, which enforces sub-filtering offers based on uniqId or owner.
-   Adding the new `validationFailures` field to `UniqFactoryMetadata` and `UniqMetadata` structure.

### Bugfixes

-   `defaultUniqMetadata` returns the source template URL for variants factory instead of `null`.

## Release 0.2.0

### Key Highlights

-   Introducing the `uniqEffectiveBuyOffers`. Please refer to the `uniqEffectiveBuyOffers` queries section for detailed information. We strongly advise utilizing this feature to retrieve all currently active offers.
-   Presenting the `uniqBuyOffers`. For more details, see the `uniqBuyOffers` queries section. We strongly encourage using this feature to retrieve specific offers, which may include expired offers or those related to burned uniq.

### Bugfixes

-   Addressed issues where metadata remained stuck in processing state without any reported errors.
-   Corrected occurrences of HTTP 500 errors instead of 400 errors for subscriptions used over HTTP protocol rather than WebSocket.

## Release 0.1.0

### Key Highlights

-   Introducing the `uniqSnapshots` subscription! Refer to the `uniqSnapshots` subscription section for more information. We highly recommend using this new subscription. Please note that the `uniqsOfFactory` and `uniqsOfWallet` subscriptions are now deprecated.
-   Introducing the `uniqFactorySnapshots` subscription! Refer to the `uniqFactorySnapshots` subscription section for more information. We highly recommend using this new subscription. Please note that the `uniqFactories` subscription is now deprecated.
-   Explore the new `uniqGlobalShares` query! Find details in the `uniqGlobalShares` query section. We strongly recommend using this query to compute sale shares prices. The `uniqGlobalShares` query provides the protocol fee basis point applied to each resale. Reminder: Owner revenue = Price - (Price x 0.0001 x (Protocol fee basis point + Promoter fee basis point + Creators shares basis point)).

### Breaking changes

-   **Removed** enum `BlockStep` - The Ultra API will now reflect only irreversible transactions.

-   **Removed** type `UniqRevenue`

-   **Renamed** type `UniqFactoryResaleShare` to `UniqSaleShare`

-   **Structure changes** of the `UniqResale`.
    ```
    type UniqResale {
        onSaleDate: Date!
        price: UniqRevenue!
    }
    ```
    Becomes :
    ```
    type UniqResale {
        onSaleDate: Date!
        price: MonetaryAmount!
        promoterBasisPoints: Int
        shares: [UniqSaleShare!]!
    }
    ```

### Bugfixes

-   Resolved issues related to metadata not being present for old uniqs or factory. The API now correctly includes metadata for all uniqs and factory instances.
-   Fixed issues with trading/transfer windows. Users can now perform trading and transfers without encountering unexpected errors or disruptions.

# Understanding GraphQL Subscriptions

GraphQL subscriptions enable a real-time connection between the client and the server, allowing the server to push updates to the client when specific events occur. Subscriptions can be used for live queries or as a stream of events. The `graphql-ws` library simplifies the process of implementing these subscriptions.

## Basic Concept of Subscriptions

Unlike queries and mutations, which follow a request-response pattern, subscriptions use a persistent connection (typically via WebSocket) to push updates from the server to the client.

## Setting Up with `graphql-ws`

To implement subscriptions with the `graphql-ws` library, follow these basic steps:

1. **Install the Library**: Ensure you have the `graphql-ws` library installed.

2. **Establish a WebSocket Connection**: Create a WebSocket connection using the `graphql-ws` library.

3. **Authenticate the Connection**: During the connection initialization, include an authorization header to authenticate the user. This is crucial for secure communications.

4. **Schedule a refresh of the token**: After the authentication phase your access token will have an expiration time. So you must schedule a ping message with a refreshed access token before your current access token expire. This operation must be recursivelly repeated.

5. **Subscribe to Events**: Use the connection to subscribe to the desired events. When these events occur, the server will push updates to the client.

## Step-by-Step Example with Code

### 1. Creating the WebSocket Client

```javascript
import { createClient } from 'graphql-ws';

const client = createClient({
    url: 'wss://your-graphql-endpoint/graphql',
    connectionParams: {
        headers: {
            authorization: 'Bearer your_user_token',
        },
    },
});
```


### 2. Schedule token refresh

```javascript
function scheduleTokenRefresh(currentToken) {
    setTimeout(
    async () => {
            // implement the refreshToken with your favorite libraries...
            const newToken = refreshToken(currentToken.refresh_token);
            const payload = { Authorization: `Bearer ${newToken.access_token}` };
            await client.ping(payload);
            scheduleTokenRefresh(newToken);
        },
        // expire_in is in seconds
        currentToken.expires_in * 1000 - 10 * 1000, // substract 10 seconds
    );
}
```

### 3. Subscribing to a Subscription

```javascript
client.subscribe(
    {
        query: `subscription {
          eventOccurred {
            field1
            field2
          }
        }`,
    },
    {
        next: (data) => console.log(data),
        error: (err) => console.error(err),
        complete: () => console.log('Subscription complete'),
    },
);
```

## Postman: Testing an Example WebSocket Connections

### 1. Creating a WebSocket Request

-   Open Postman and create a new WebSocket request.
-   Set the URL to your GraphQL subscription endpoint (e.g., `wss://your-graphql-endpoint/graphql`).
-   Add the correct sub-protocol `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol : graphql-transport-ws` on header section.

### 2. Initializing the Connection

-   In the "Text" tab, enter the following JSON payload to initialize the connection with the authorization header:

    ```json
    {
        "type": "connection_init",
        "payload": {
            "headers": { "authorization": "Bearer {{BEARER_TOKEN}}" }
        }
    }
    ```

-   Click the "Connect" button to establish the WebSocket connection.

### 3. Subscribing to a GraphQL Subscription

-   After the connection is successfully initialized, enter the following JSON payload to subscribe to a GraphQL subscription:

    ```json
    {
        "id": "d77e14e3-9ef2-43a3-a15e-d81a5f346f73",
        "type": "subscribe",
        "payload": {
            "variables": {
                "positionStrategy": "EARLIEST"
            },
            "query": "subscription UniqFactorySnapshots( $positionStrategy: StreamPositionStrategy!) { uniqFactorySnapshots( positionStrategy: $positionStrategy ) { cursor id position state { accountMintingLimit assetCreator assetManager authorizedMinters { quantity walletId } conditionlessReceivers defaultUniqMetadata { cachedSource { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } content { attributes { descriptor { description dynamic name type } key value } description dynamicAttributes { contentType uris } dynamicResources { key value { contentType uris } } medias { gallery { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } hero { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } product { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } square { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } } name properties resources { key value { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } } subName } source { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } status } firsthandPurchases { groupRestriction { excludes includes } id option { factories { count id strategy } transferUniqsReceiver } price { amount currency { code symbol } } promoterBasisPoints purchaseLimit purchaseWindow { endDate startDate } purchasedUniqs saleShares { basisPoints receiver } uosPayment } id metadata { cachedSource { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } content { attributes { key value { description dynamic name type } } description medias { gallery { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } hero { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } product { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } square { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } } name properties resources { key value { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } } subName } locked source { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } status } mintableWindow { endDate startDate } resale { minimumPrice { amount currency { code symbol } } shares { basisPoints receiver } } status stock { authorized existing maxMintable mintable minted } tradingWindow { endDate startDate } transferWindow { endDate startDate } type } } }"
        }
    }
    ```

-   Click the "Send" button to start the subscription.

### 4. Handling the Cursor Value

For subsequent requests, include the cursor value if it is not the first subscription. Here is an example of how to modify the subscription request to include the cursor value:

```json
{
    "id": "d77e14e3-9ef2-43a3-a15e-d81a5f346f73",
    "type": "subscribe",
    "payload": {
        "variables": {
            "cursor": "1k05ksqt9v3ew",
            "positionStrategy": "EARLIEST"
        },
        "query": "subscription UniqFactorySnapshots( $cursor: StreamCursor, $positionStrategy: StreamPositionStrategy!) { uniqFactorySnapshots( cursor: $cursor, positionStrategy: $positionStrategy ) { cursor id position state { accountMintingLimit assetCreator assetManager authorizedMinters { quantity walletId } conditionlessReceivers defaultUniqMetadata { cachedSource { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } content { attributes { descriptor { description dynamic name type } key value } description dynamicAttributes { contentType uris } dynamicResources { key value { contentType uris } } medias { gallery { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } hero { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } product { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } square { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } } name properties resources { key value { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } } subName } source { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } status } firsthandPurchases { groupRestriction { excludes includes } id option { factories { count id strategy } transferUniqsReceiver } price { amount currency { code symbol } } promoterBasisPoints purchaseLimit purchaseWindow { endDate startDate } purchasedUniqs saleShares { basisPoints receiver } uosPayment } id metadata { cachedSource { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } content { attributes { key value { description dynamic name type } } description medias { gallery { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } hero { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } product { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } square { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } } name properties resources { key value { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } } subName } locked source { contentType integrity { hash type } uri } status } mintableWindow { endDate startDate } resale { minimumPrice { amount currency { code symbol } } shares { basisPoints receiver } } status stock { authorized existing maxMintable mintable minted } tradingWindow { endDate startDate } transferWindow { endDate startDate } type } } }"
    }
}
```

title: 'Core API Methods'

order: 2
outline: [0, 4]

# Core API Methods

The `@ultraos/wallet-sdk` provides a unified interface for interacting with both the Ultra Web Wallet and the Ultra Wallet Extension. This means you can implement wallet functionality once, and the SDK will handle which wallet environment (web or extension) is used behind the scenes.

## Response Format

The Ultra Web Wallet SDK returns responses in the same format as the Ultra Wallet Extension.

Each successful method call returns a consistent object structure with the following top-level fields:

-   `status`: Always `"success"` for resolved calls
-   `data`: The actual payload of the response, specific to each method

Example structure:

```ts
{
  status: "success",
  data: {
    // method-specific values here
  }
}
```

For full details on the structure of each method’s response, refer to the shared documentation:

[See Ultra Wallet Response Format →](../ultra-wallet/response-format.md)

## Connect

Initiates the connection process with the wallet. For Web Wallet users, this includes authenticating via Ultra SSO and registering the device.

```ts
try {
    const response = await wallet.connect();
    response.data.blockchainid;
    // ej1vx2ft3ht4
    response.data.publicKey;
    // EOS7uRb72dR8jrLjNuC9UoevBBH3YbVZfNKUtYCfLkV7aPGcmDjs7
} catch (err) {
    // { status: "error", message: "Connection rejected" }
}
```

### Eagerly Connecting

After a web application connects to the Ultra Wallet for the first time, it gains a trusted status.
Once this trust is established, the application can seamlessly link with Ultra Wallet during future visits or when the page is refreshed,
eliminating the need to ask the user for authorization. This concept is commonly known as "eagerly connecting".

To implement this, web applications should pass an `onlyIfTrusted` option into the `connect()` call.

```ts
try {
    await wallet.connect({ onlyIfTrusted: true });
} catch (err) {
    // { status: 'error', code: 4001, message: 'The user rejected the request.' }
}
```

### Sending a Referral Code

An application can send its referral code to the wallet. The referral code will be used if the user signs up during the connection process.

To implement this, applications should pass the `referralCode` option into the `connect()` call.

```ts
wallet.connect({ referralCode: 'ecd1f052-9d0d-4b84-8dd3-10a753d044b5' });
```

To get your referral code, go to the Ultra Desktop client and then to the Wallet, and look for the "My referral link" section. Click the link to copy it.

Once you copy your referral link, you can extract the referral code from the URL. For example, from the following link:

```
https://ultra.io/register/ecd1f052-9d0d-4b84-8dd3-10a753d044b5
```

The referral code is: `ecd1f052-9d0d-4b84-8dd3-10a753d044b5`.


### Connect with Nonce

To streamline authentication flows and avoid browser restrictions on multiple popup windows, the `connect()` method supports an optional `nonce` parameter. When provided, the Ultra Web Wallet will automatically sign the nonce after completing key synchronization.

This is particularly useful for dApps that need to verify user identity using a signed challenge (i.e., the nonce) — commonly used in Web3 login/session flows.

:::info Note
If the `nonce` parameter is specified, the `connect()` method will always prompt the user to reconnect, even if a trusted session already exists.
:::

#### Usage

```ts
try {
  const response = await wallet.connect({ nonce: 'abc123randomnonce' });

  console.log(response.data.blockchainid);     // e.g., "aa1aa2aa3aa4"
  console.log(response.data.publicKey);        // e.g., "EOS7HUZZ6AQvrEi3wGRrKd2A3CuktaeM6xnguA2CrVxH9BUMB5aRx"
  console.log(response.data.nonce);            // "message: abc123randomnonce" (note: nonce must start with 'message:', '0x', or 'UOSx')
  console.log(response.data.signedNonce);      // Signed message
} catch (err) {
  // { status: "error", message: "Connection rejected" }
}
```

> **Important:** The `nonce` string must begin with one of the supported prefixes: `'message:'`, `'0x'`, or `'UOSx'`. This ensures compatibility with Ultra Wallet’s signature rules.

#### Response Format

When a `nonce` is provided, the response `data` object will include:

- `blockchainid`: User's Ultra Blockchain ID
- `publicKey`: Associated public key
- `nonce`: The original nonce sent by the dApp
- `signedNonce`: The message signature generated by the Ultra Wallet

This signed payload can then be verified off-chain or used to create stateless sessions server-side.

> Note: The signed message uses the standard `signMessage()` behavior with the same signature rules.


## Disconnect

The `disconnect()` method revokes the connection permission that the user granted to the web application. If the application is already disconnected, the Promise will throw an error.

```ts
try {
  await wallet.disconnect();
} catch (err) {
  // { status: "error", message: "Forbidden" }
```

## Sign Message

In some cases, a web application can also request the user to sign a given message to verify the ownership of a blockchain account. Applications are free to write their messages which will be displayed to users from within the Ultra Wallet's signature prompt using the method `signMessage()`. These messages should have one of the following prefixes: `0x`, `UOSx`, or `message:`.

```ts
const signature = await wallet.signMessage('message: Hello, blockchain!');
```

:::info
Message signatures do not involve network fees.
:::

## Sign Transaction

Once a web application is connected to the Ultra Wallet, it can prompt the user for permission to sign and push transactions on their behalf.

### Create a transaction object

Ultra Wallet uses a simplified format for transaction objects. The required fields are `action`, `contract`, and `data`.

Example: sending tokens between accounts.

```json
{
    "action": "transfer",
    "contract": "eosio.token",
    "data": {
        "memo": "This is a transaction test",
        "quantity": "11.20000000 UOS",
        "from": "ej1vx2ft3ht4",
        "to": "nwyklp2aa1qd"
    }
}
```

### Sign the transaction object

Once the transaction is created, you can request the wallet to sign and broadcast it using `signTransaction()`:

```ts
try {
    const response = await wallet.signTransaction(txObject);
    response.data.transactionHash;
    // 51c6d324522a0ee05baeee2a8857b016e47481207850074ee83f914e6adc45ae
} catch (err) {
    // { status: "error", message: "Transaction declined" }
}
```

### Sign multiple transactions at the same time

You can also pass an array of transactions to sign them together in a single call:

```ts
const txArray = [
    {
        action: 'transfer',
        contract: 'eosio.token',
        data: {
            memo: '',
            quantity: '11.20000000 UOS',
            from: 'ej1vx2ft3ht4',
            to: 'nwyklp2aa1qd',
        },
    },
    {
        action: 'buy',
        contract: 'eosio.nft.ft',
        data: {
            buy: {
                token_id: 9974,
                buyer: 'mg1vg2lv3fs4',
                receiver: 'mg1vg2lv3fs4',
                max_price: '78.00000000 UOS',
                memo: '',
                promoter_id: null,
            },
        },
    },
];

try {
    const response = await wallet.signTransaction(txArray);
    response.data.transactionHash;
} catch (err) {
    // { status: "error", message: "Transaction declined" }
}
```

### Sign a transaction without broadcasting to the blockchain

You can sign one or more transactions and receive the full signed payload without broadcasting it by passing `{ signOnly: true }`:

```ts
try {
    const response = await wallet.signTransaction(txObject, { signOnly: true });
    response.data;
    /**
   {
      "expiration": "...",
      "ref_block_num": ...,
      "actions": [...],
      "signatures": [...],
      ...
   }
  */
} catch (err) {
    // { status: "error", message: "Transaction declined" }
}
```

## Get Chain ID

Retrieves the current chain ID based on the environment configuration.

```ts
const chainId = await wallet.getChainId();
```

## Purchase Item

To facilitate the purchase of a Uniq Factory with FIAT or blockchain tokens, the Ultra platform provides the `wallet.purchaseItem(itemType, itemId)` method. This method initiates a complete purchase flow for a specific item, identified by its type and ID on the blockchain.

### Parameters

-   `itemType`: For Uniq Factory purchases, use `"UniqFactory"`.
-   `itemId`: The numeric identifier of the Uniq Factory product on the blockchain.

When this method is called, a popup will appear showing the Ultra purchase flow. Users can complete their purchase using credit/debit cards or UOS tokens.

Upon success, the result includes:

-   `orderHash`: Reference ID for customer support
-   `items`: An array of purchased items containing:
    -   `productId`: The requested item ID
    -   `artifactId`: The minted Uniq on the blockchain
    -   `blockchainTransactionId`: Transaction ID confirming the mint on-chain

If the user cancels or an error occurs, the promise will reject with an error message.

```ts
try {
    const response = await wallet.purchaseItem('UniqFactory', '599');
    // {
    //   status: "success",
    //   data: {
    //     orderHash: "XXX",
    //     items: [{
    //       productId: 599,
    //       artifactId: 7777,
    //       blockchainTransactionId: "XXX",
    //     }],
    //   },
    // }
} catch (err) {
    // { status: "error", message: "Purchase canceled" }
}
```

## Error Codes

The Ultra Web Wallet SDK follows the same error interface as the Ultra Wallet Extension.

When a method fails (e.g., the user cancels a transaction or rejects a connection request), the rejected promise will contain a standardized error object with fields like `status`, `code`, and `message`.

You can refer to the shared error documentation for full details on all possible error responses:

See [Ultra Wallet Error Codes](../ultra-wallet/errors.md).

# FAQ / Troubleshooting

Below are common questions and issues developers may encounter when integrating or using the Ultra Web Wallet via the `@ultraos/wallet-sdk`.

## Why am I seeing "EBA account required"?

The Ultra Web Wallet currently supports only **Easy Blockchain Account (EBA)** users. If you're using a self-managed account, you won't be able to connect via the Web Wallet. Ensure the account you're testing with is EBA-enabled.

## The wallet doesn't connect. What should I check?

-   Confirm the `env` parameter matches the desired Ultra environment (e.g., `'testnet'`, `'mainnet'`).
-   Ensure you're using a compatible browser with secure (HTTPS) context.
-   Check your app’s domain is approved to interact with Ultra SSO if necessary.
-   Clear local storage or try an incognito window for a fresh auth attempt.

## Why is the Ultra Wallet Extension being used instead of the Web Wallet?

The SDK automatically checks if the Ultra Wallet Extension is installed. If detected, it takes priority over the Web Wallet to maintain compatibility with user preferences. To test Web Wallet specifically, disable or uninstall the extension.

## Can I use this SDK in mobile browsers?

Yes. The Ultra Web Wallet SDK is compatible with mobile browsers, although support is still considered experimental. Functionality may vary depending on browser capabilities and operating system restrictions.

## I'm not seeing anything or getting a browser error—what should I check?

The Ultra Web Wallet requires permission to open a popup window to complete certain actions such as connecting the wallet or processing a transaction.

If nothing happens when calling a method like `connect()` or `purchaseItem()`, ensure the following:

-   Your application is not blocking popups via custom browser settings or extensions.
-   The user has not previously blocked popups for your domain.
-   The action was initiated as a result of a direct user gesture (e.g., button click), as modern browsers restrict popups outside user-initiated events.

If you're testing locally, try enabling popups for `localhost` or your local dev server's URL.

## What if I need to switch networks?

The `env` option passed to `UltraWallet` must match the target Ultra blockchain environment. You cannot dynamically switch environments after instantiating the SDK—you’ll need to re-initialize with a new configuration.

## Where are keys stored and is it safe?

The private key is securely stored in the user’s browser, encrypted with a key partially derived from Ultra. Ultra cannot access the full key, and signing occurs client-side, ensuring high levels of security.

# Getting Started

To begin using the Ultra Web Wallet in your application, you’ll need to integrate the `@ultraos/wallet-sdk`. This SDK provides a unified interface for both the Ultra Wallet Extension and the Ultra Web Wallet.

## Installation

First, install the SDK via npm:

```bash
npm install @ultraos/wallet-sdk
```

## SDK Initialization

To begin interacting with Ultra Web Wallet or Ultra Wallet Extension, you need to create an instance of the `UltraWallet` class provided by the `@ultraos/wallet-sdk`.

This instance will be used throughout your application to trigger wallet connections, sign transactions, and more.

```ts
import { UltraWallet } from '@ultraos/wallet-sdk';

const wallet = new UltraWallet({
  env: 'testnet', // Required. Defines the target Ultra network.
});
```

The `env` option determines which Ultra blockchain network the wallet connects to. Supported values:

- `'mainnet'` – Ultra's production blockchain.
- `'testnet'` – Public network for development and testing.

Unlike the Ultra Wallet Extension—which allows users to select their active network manually—the Web Wallet relies on this `env` configuration to determine network context at runtime.

::: warning
⚠️ Always verify that your environment is set appropriately before deploying to production.
:::

## Connecting the Wallet

Use the `connect()` method to initiate the login process and register the device with the Ultra Web Wallet:

```ts
const result = await wallet.connect();
console.log('Connected:', result);
```

If the Ultra Wallet Extension is installed, it will be used by default. Otherwise, the SDK will automatically fall back to the Web Wallet.

## Disconnecting

To log out the user and clear local credentials:

```ts
await wallet.disconnect();
```

## ⚠️ Important: Popup Handling Requirements

To ensure proper functioning of the Ultra Web Wallet, **all API calls that trigger UI actions (such as connect, purchase, or signature requests)** must be initiated **within a direct user action**, such as a `click` or `tap` event.

Browsers enforce strict popup blockers for non-user-initiated windows. If your call to the wallet (e.g., `ultra.connect()` or `ultra.purchaseItem()`) is not triggered from a user interaction, the popup will likely be blocked, and no action will occur.

### ✅ Correct Usage (inside a button event):

```js
button.addEventListener("click", async () => {
  await wallet.connect();
});
```

### ❌ Incorrect Usage (auto-triggered or delayed):

```js
// This will likely be blocked
setTimeout(() => {
  wallet.connect();
}, 1000);
```

:::info TIP
🛡 Always ensure wallet methods are triggered synchronously inside user input events to avoid UX issues.
::: 


## Next Steps

After connecting, you can:

- Sign blockchain transactions with `signTransaction()`
- Sign raw messages with `signMessage()`
- Get the current chain ID with `getChainId()`
- Perform on-chain purchases with `purchaseItem()`

These methods are covered in detail in the [Core API Methods](./core-api-methods.md).

# Detecting the Blockchain Network

The Ultra blockchain is distinguished by a unique identifier that facilitates the identification of the associated blockchain network. 
This essential information can be retrieved through the Wallet extension using the following method.

```JavaScript
try {
    const response = await ultra.getChainId();
    response.data;

title: 'Detecting the Ultra Wallet'

order: 4
outline: [0, 4]
---

# Detecting the Ultra Wallet

To detect if a user has already installed the Ultra Wallet browser extension the web application should run over **HTTPS** and check for the existence of an `ultra` object in the `window` variable.

```JavaScript
if ('ultra' in window) {
  console.log('Ultra Wallet is installed!');
}
```

This code can be called when you want (for example, when clicking on a button or a link).  
If you want this check to be carried out automatically when the web page loads, you will need to integrate it into the `load` event in the `window` variable:

```JavaScript
if(document.readyState !== 'complete') {
    window.addEventListener('load',afterWindowLoaded);
} else {
    afterWindowLoaded();
}

function afterWindowLoaded(){
    if ('ultra' in window) {
        console.log('Page load: Ultra Wallet is installed!');
    } else {
        console.log('Page load: No Ultra Wallet extension detected!');
    }
}
```

# Developer resources

## Local server

The Ultra wallet extension is only active when the page in the browser uses the HTTPS protocol. That means that you will need a local server with SSL enabled. Many frameworks have an option to easily configure it for you, but if you need a quick development environment, we recommend:

-   [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/)
-   [@vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl)

## Ultra Wallet types

---
title: 'Establishing a Connection'

order: 6
outline: [0, 4]
---

# Establishing a Connection

To begin interacting with the Ultra Wallet, a web application must first establish a connection. This connection request will ask the user for permission to share its blockchain id and public key, indicating that they are willing to continue interacting. Once the permission is set for the first time, the web application domain will be whitelisted for future connection requests.
Similarly, it is possible to terminate the connection both on the application and on the user side.

## Connecting

```JavaScript
try {
    const response = await ultra.connect();
    response.data.blockchainid;
    // ej1vx2ft3ht4
    response.data.publicKey;
    // EOS7uRb72dR8jrLjNuC9UoevBBH3YbVZfNKUtYCfLkV7aPGcmDjs7
} catch (err) {
    // { status: "error", message: "Connection rejected" }
}
```

The `connect()` call will return a Promise that is resolved when the user accepts the connection request and is rejected when the user rejects the request or closes the popup.

### Eagerly Connecting

After a web application connects to the Ultra Wallet for the first time, it gains a trusted status.
Once this trust is established, the application can seamlessly link with Ultra Wallet during future visits or when the page is refreshed,
eliminating the need to ask the user for authorization. This concept is commonly known as "eagerly connecting".

To implement this, web applications should pass an `onlyIfTrusted` option into the `connect()` call.

```JavaScript
try {
    await ultra.connect({onlyIfTrusted: true});
} catch (err) {
    // { status: 'error', code: 4001, message: 'The user rejected the request.' }
}
```

### Sending a referral code

An application can send its referral code to the wallet. The referral code will be used if the user signs up during the connection process.

To implement this, applications should pass the referralCode option into the connect() call.

```JavaScript
ultra.connect({referralCode: 'ecd1f052-9d0d-4b84-8dd3-10a753d044b5'});
```

To get your referral code, go to the Ultra Desktop client and then to the Wallet, and look for the "My referral link" section, click on the link to copy it.

Once you copy your referral link you can get the referral code from the URL. For example, the next link https://ultra.io/register/ecd1f052-9d0d-4b84-8dd3-10a753d044b5 has the referral code `ecd1f052-9d0d-4b84-8dd3-10a753d044b5`.

### Connect with Nonce

To streamline authentication flows and avoid browser restrictions on multiple popup windows, the `connect()` method supports an optional `nonce` parameter. When provided, the Ultra Web Wallet will automatically sign the nonce after completing key synchronization.

This is particularly useful for dApps that need to verify user identity using a signed challenge (i.e., the nonce) — commonly used in Web3 login/session flows.

#### Usage

```ts
try {
  const response = await ultra.connect({ nonce: 'abc123randomnonce' });

  console.log(response.data.blockchainid);     // e.g., "aa1aa2aa3aa4"
  console.log(response.data.publicKey);        // e.g., "EOS7HUZZ6AQvrEi3wGRrKd2A3CuktaeM6xnguA2CrVxH9BUMB5aRx"
  console.log(response.data.nonce);            // "message: abc123randomnonce"
  console.log(response.data.signedNonce);      // Signed message
} catch (err) {
  // { status: "error", message: "Connection rejected" }
}
```

> **Important:** The `nonce` string must begin with one of the supported prefixes: `'message:'`, `'0x'`, or `'UOSx'`. This ensures compatibility with Ultra Wallet’s signature rules.

#### Response Format

When a `nonce` is provided, the response `data` object will include:

- `blockchainid`: User's Ultra Blockchain ID
- `publicKey`: Associated public key
- `nonce`: The original nonce sent by the dApp
- `signedNonce`: The message signature generated by the Ultra Wallet

This signed payload can then be verified off-chain or used to create stateless sessions server-side.

> Note: The signed message uses the standard `signMessage()` behavior with the same signature rules.

## Disconnecting

```JavaScript
try {
  await ultra.disconnect();
} catch (err) {
  // { status: "error", message: "Forbidden" }
}
```

The `disconnect()` method revokes the connection permission that the user granted to the web application, if the application is already disconnected, the Promise will throw an error.

To handle disconnections, the app can also subscribe to disconnect events.

```JavaScript
ultra.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.log('Disconnected from Ultra Wallet');
})
```

# Events

The Ultra Wallet can emit different events to notify applications about changes happening inside the Wallet.

To subscribe/unsubscribe from these events, the following methods are available:

-   `ultra.on(eventName, callback)`
-   `ultra.off(eventName, callback)`
-   `ultra.once(eventName, callback)`
-   `ultra.prependListener(eventName, callback)`
-   `ultra.prependOnceListener(eventName, callback)`
-   `ultra.addListener(eventName, callback)`
-   `ultra.removeListener(eventName, callback)`

| Event name | Description                                                           |

# How to get tokens on Testnet

Issuing tokens to your account on Ultra's Testnet blockchain is done using the Ultra faucet tool [Ultra Testnet Tools](https://faucet.testnet.app.ultra.io/). In the Ultra Wallet, when you are using a Testnet account, the "Buy UOS" button also redirects to this tool.

![](/images/uwax-home-buy-uos.png)

When you open the Faucet, you have to copy/paste your blockchain account, pass the captcha quiz, and click the button “Issue”. There is a rate limit of 10 UOS every two minutes.

# Import your account’s private key

The Ultra Wallet Extension supports two kinds of accounts: Ultra Account and Ultra Pro Wallet. To understand how a private key can be imported into the wallet, we have to explain first the differences between both account types.

## Ultra Account (Easy Blockchain Account)

One of the most critical missions of Ultra is to democratize the blockchain, bringing all its advantages to the mass market. To do so, it was required to simplify drastically how the blockchain is managed, making it almost transparent for the user.

The Ultra Account is an account type where the users store their own private keys in their devices and Ultra only provides a way to recover a blockchain account or sync a private key with a blockchain account.

![](/images/uwax-login-btns.png)

To get an Easy Blockchain Account you only have to create an Ultra account using the Ultra Wallet Extension or the Ultra Desktop client.

## Ultra Pro Wallet (Self-managed blockchain account)

An Ultra Pro Wallet is a typical blockchain account controlled by private keys that you must secure yourself. This type of account is recommended for developers and other advanced users. To learn more about how to generate your own keys, read this [documentation page](../../blockchain/general/tools/nodeos.md).

![](/images/uwax-private-key-btn.png)

To import your blockchain account’s private key, use the `Use Private Key & Password` option in the wallet extension. The wallet will ask you for a strong password to encrypt your keys. This password is not stored in the wallet so you have to save it securely. Without this password, you won’t be able to unlock your wallet again.

Once the private key is imported and encrypted, you will be able to select and activate the associated Ultra blockchain accounts.

# Ultra Wallet Browser Extension

![](/images/uwax_main.png)

The Ultra Wallet browser extension is a crypto wallet that allows you to access decentralized applications on Ultra's blockchain and securely manage your digital assets.

The principal functions are to create and manage private keys on behalf of its users, to manage the connections between the wallet and web applications, and allow users to securely sign transactions.

To interact with the wallet, the wallet injects an object named `ultra` into the javascript context of every site. This object contains all the methods required to obtain the user's blockchain id, their public key, and to sign blockchain transactions.

# Uniq Factory purchase using FIAT or UOS

To facilitate the purchase of an Uniq Factory with FIAT or Blockchain tokens, the Ultra platform provides the `ultra.purchaseItem(itemType, itemId)` API method. This method is designed to initiate the purchase process for a specific item, identified by its type and unique ID on the blockchain.

API Method: `ultra.purchaseItem(itemType, itemId)`
- `itemType`: For Uniq Factory purchases, this value should be "UniqFactory".
- `itemId`: The identifier of the Uniq Factory on the blockchain.

When this API method is called, it triggers a popup window displaying the Ultra purchase flow. This flow allows users to complete their purchase using Credit or Debit cards, as well as UOS tokens. Upon successful payment, Ultra mints the Uniq to the user and returns the following information as the result of the API call:
- `orderHash`: An ID used for support requests if required.
- `items`: An array of purchased elements
  - `productId`: The item ID that was sent in the API call.
  - `artifactId`: The minted Uniq ID on the blockchain.
  - `blockchainTransactionId`: The transaction ID on the blockchain, useful for tracking the status and details.

If the user cancels the purchase flow by either closing the window or explicitly canceling the purchase in the user UI, or if an error related to the payment occurs, the API will throw an error. The error message will provide details about the cancellation.

```JavaScript
try {
  const response = await ultra.purchaseItem("UniqFactory", "599");
  response
  // {
  //   status: "success",
  //   data: {
  //     orderHash: "XXX",
  //     items: [{
  //       productId: 599,
  //       artifactId: 7777,
  //       blockchainTransactionId: "XXX",
  //     }],
  //   },
  // }
} catch (err) {
  // { status: "error", message: "Purchase canceled" }
}
```

title: 'Signing a Transaction'

# Signing a Transaction

Once a web application is connected to the Ultra Wallet, it can prompt the user for permission to sign and push transactions on their behalf.

The requirements to send a transaction are:

## Create a transaction object

Ultra Wallet has its own format for transaction objects that makes it easy to understand and fulfill. The required fields are “action”, “contract” and “data”.

Below is a transaction example to send tokens from a user's blockchain account to another one.

```JSON
{
  "action": "transfer",
  "contract": "eosio.token",
  "data": {
    "memo": "This is a transaction test",
    "quantity": "11.20000000 UOS",
    "from": "ej1vx2ft3ht4",
    "to": "nwyklp2aa1qd"
  }
}
```

## Sign the transaction object

When the transaction object is created, the web application may ask for permission from the Ultra Wallet to sign and send the transaction using `signTransaction()`. This returns a Promise. If accepted, the wallet will sign the transaction with the user's private key and submit it to the Ultra blockchain. Conversely, if the user declines the transaction or closes the window, the Promise will return an error.

```JavaScript
try {
  const response = await ultra.signTransaction(txObject);
  response.data.transactionHash;
  // 51c6d324522a0ee05baeee2a8857b016e47481207850074ee83f914e6adc45ae
} catch (err) {
  // { status: "error", message: "Transaction declined" }
}
```

Once the transaction is executed, the transaction hash is returned and it can be validated on the blockchain.

## Sign multiple transactions at the same time

The `signTransaction()` method accepts one transaction object or an array of them to sign multiple transaction objects in the same transaction. For example, it’s possible to sign a **transfer** and **buy** action in the same transaction as shown in the next example.

```JavaScript
const txArray = [{
    "action": "transfer",
    "contract": "eosio.token",
    "data": {
        "memo": "",
        "quantity": "11.20000000 UOS",
        "from": "ej1vx2ft3ht4",
        "to": "nwyklp2aa1qd"
    }
},
    {
        "action": "buy",
        "contract": "eosio.nft.ft",
        "data": {
            "buy": {
                "token_id": 9974,
                "buyer": "mg1vg2lv3fs4",
                "receiver": "mg1vg2lv3fs4",
                "max_price": "78.00000000 UOS",
                "memo": "",
                "promoter_id": null
            }
        }
    }
];

try {
    const response = await ultra.signTransaction(txArray);
    response.data.transactionHash;
    // 51c6d324522a0ee05baeee2a8857b016e47481207850074ee83f914e6adc45ae
} catch (err) {
    // { status: "error", message: "Transaction declined" }
}
```

## Sign a transaction without broadcasting to the blockchain

If you want to sign a transaction (or an array of transactions) using the current active account in your wallet without immediately sending it to the blockchain, you can pass an options object with the `signOnly` flag set to `true`.

Using the `signOnly: true` option tells the Ultra Wallet to sign the transaction(s) and return the complete signed data, rather than broadcasting it to the blockchain network. This is particularly useful when you need to:

-   Validate or inspect the signed transaction details before sending them
-   Manage transactions in multiple steps, such as signing first and sending later
-   Sign with multiple accounts

Here is an example of how to use the `signOnly` option:

```JavaScript
try {
  const response = await ultra.signTransaction(txObject, { signOnly: true });
  response.data;
  /**
   {
      "expiration": "2025-02-13T19:33:10",

                  {
                      "actor": "zp1ix2rg3iw4",
                      "permission": "active"
                  }

      ],

  */
} catch (err) {
  // { status: "error", message: "Transaction declined" }
}
```

# Signing a Message

In some cases, a web application can also request the user to sign a given message to verify the ownership of a blockchain account. Applications are free to write their messages which will be displayed to users from within the Ultra Wallet's signature prompt using the method `signMessage()`. These messages should have one of the next prefixes: `0x`, `UOSx`, or `message:`.

**Message signatures do not involve network fees.**

```JavaScript
try {
  const response = await ultra.signMessage("message:This is a test message");
  response.data.signature;
  // SIG_K1_KXuKhsxcdDTKuMbo2kveKsggwUfV9p5FuPsirkFcjjQo2sxUvxcc1TEnkoancsWTf6SEHj1jMjB9e6GuRkg6ZrEvV5tHa8
} catch (err) {
  // { status: "error", message: "Transaction declined" }
}
```

If the user declines the message signing or closes the window, the Promise will return an error.

# How It Works

The Ultra Web Wallet is tightly integrated with the Ultra ecosystem to provide a smooth and secure Web3 experience without requiring users to install browser extensions.

## Authentication & Key Management

When a user connects via Ultra Web Wallet, the authentication flow begins with Ultra SSO (Single Sign-On). This process:

- Authenticates the user.
- Registers the device with Ultra's EBA (Easy Blockchain Account) service.
- Securely synchronizes a private key that is stored on the user's local device.

Ultra does not store full private keys. Instead, keys are split and encrypted—one part held by Ultra and the other stored securely on the client device—ensuring non-custodial ownership.

## Fallback Strategy: Extension or Web Wallet

The `@ultraos/wallet-sdk` automatically detects whether the Ultra Wallet Extension is installed. If it is, the extension is prioritized. If not, the SDK seamlessly falls back to the Web Wallet experience.

This makes it easy for developers to support both environments without needing to change implementation logic.

## Signing Flow

Once authenticated, any Web3 event—such as signing messages or submitting transactions—can be triggered by the client application using the Wallet SDK. The general flow is:

1. App requests an action via SDK (e.g., `signTransaction()`).
2. SDK communicates with Ultra Web Wallet UI.
3. Web Wallet securely signs the transaction.
4. Result is returned to the app for submission or follow-up logic.

This flow abstracts away the complexity of handling private keys, making Ultra Web Wallet a powerful tool for dApp developers.

# Ultra Web Wallet


![](/images/web-wallet-main.png)

The **Ultra Web Wallet** is a browser-based, non-custodial wallet designed to enable seamless and secure interaction with the Ultra blockchain. It offers full Web3 capabilities through a lightweight, installation-free experience tailored for EBA (Easy Blockchain Account) users.

Unlike traditional browser extensions, Ultra Web Wallet stores the user's private key directly on their device in an encrypted format. This ensures user ownership and security while eliminating the need for external installations. 

To simplify integration, Ultra provides a unified JavaScript SDK (`@ultraos/wallet-sdk`) that supports both the Web Wallet and the Ultra Wallet Extension. This abstraction allows developers to implement wallet features once and support both environments automatically.

Whether you're building games, marketplaces, or dApps, Ultra Web Wallet makes onboarding and secure transaction signing frictionless for users—especially those new to Web3.

::: info Note
 🔐 Ultra never stores the full private key — encryption is split between the user's device and Ultra's backend, ensuring secure key custody while maintaining decentralization principles.

# Security Model

Ultra Web Wallet is designed with a strong focus on user privacy and key safety, using a **non-custodial** approach that gives users full control of their blockchain assets without requiring external wallet software.

## Key Management

The Ultra Web Wallet uses a dual-part key encryption model:

-   **Client-side Storage:** The user's private key is stored locally in the browser, encrypted with a key only partially derived from Ultra.
-   **Ultra's Partial Key:** Ultra holds a partial encryption key used to assist in encrypting/decrypting the user’s private key, but never has full access to the key itself.

This ensures that even if Ultra's backend were compromised, user keys would remain protected.

## Device Registration via Ultra SSO

When users first log in, the SDK initiates a secure registration flow through Ultra SSO. During this process, the device is uniquely identified and securely provisioned to interact with the Web Wallet, enabling signing operations without ever exposing private keys directly.

## Transaction Signing

All blockchain interactions—such as transactions and message signing are performed **client-side**. The Web Wallet handles these securely, displaying transaction data to the user for confirmation before signing. This reduces the risk of unauthorized activity or invisible transactions.

## No Custodial Risk

Because the Ultra Web Wallet does not store complete private keys or user funds on Ultra servers, there is **no custodial liability**. This reinforces a user-first model where only the user can access and control their digital identity and assets.

## Best Practices for Developers

-   Always set the correct environment (`env`) when initializing the SDK.
-   Encourage users to use secure browsers and avoid shared/public machines.
-   Never cache or store sensitive SDK responses (e.g., signed transactions) unnecessarily.

:::info
🔐 With its layered encryption, secure device linking, and decentralized storage design, Ultra Web Wallet ensures a modern and responsible approach to Web3 security.

# Ultratest Usage

This document pertains to developers who want to write smart contracts.

## Obtaining ultratest

We have created a Docker image that has pre-created scripts, tools, and pre-packaged binaries. `ultratest` is already included inside of the Docker image.

Individual binaries are not currently available for download.

[Docker Image Usage](../../tutorials/docker/docker-image-usage.md)

## Usage

Inside the Docker Container the following can be executed for general usage.

```sh
ultratest --help
```

## Nodeos instances

Nodeos instances are automatically created in the background with a preset chain configuration.

The first instance will have the following deployed:

-   bios contract
-   protocol configurations
-   system contract
-   token contract
-   msig contract
-   various initialization actions for ram market, system currency, etc.

After the first instance has this data deployed it will take a snapshot.

This snapshot will be used to quickly reboot the chain and run each test file as necessary.

_Additional instances will be launched if additional producers are needed in a test file._

## Keosd Instances

Keosd is launched and a single wallet is created which will contain all keys that were used during the boot process for the framework.

All keys can be seen by running either of these two commands inside of the docker image.

```
cleos wallet keys
```

```
cleos wallet private_keys
```

The wallet password can be found at `~/ultratest/wallet.txt`.

## Data Persistence

During each test a system snapshot is used between each test file.

All data is wiped if a new instance of `ultratest` is ran.

However, a configuration inside of test files exists to prevent any additional rollbacks during chained tests. See [Understanding the Test Class](#understanding-the-test-class)

## Warning on Naming Files

The way that `ultratest` kills `nodeos` processes is very indiscriminate.

It matches `nodeos` and `keosd` in pkill as a search string, meaning if you are running other processes with `nodeos` or `keosd`, it will kill them as well.

This affects tests when running singular tests, for instance `ultratest -t tests/nodeos_test.ultra_test.js` will kill the test suite execution because the process has `nodeos` within the cmd.

## Starting a System Node

Options exist to start a node with system contracts deployed and will function as a normal node until you kill the nodeos instance.

```
ultratest -D -n --system
```

## Writing Tests

Test files must have a suffix of `ultra_test.js` in order to be recognized by the `ultratest` framework.

**Incorrect ->** `hello-world-test.js`

**Correct ->** `hello-world.ultra_test.js`

### Basic Format

Our test format is very specific but also has plenty of options to get most smart contract developers off the ground.

```js
module.exports = class test {
    constructor() {}

    // Deploys ultra system contracts to the nodeos instance
    requiresSystemContracts() {
        return true;
    }

    // What account to create, and what contract to deploy on it
    importContracts() {
        return [{ account: 'smrtcntract1', path: '../contracts', contract: 'hello' }];
    }

    // Created after importing contracts
    requiredAccounts() {
        return ['account1', 'account2', 'account3', 'account4'];
    }

    tests({ assert, endpoint, cleos, rpc, api, ecc, keychain }) {
        assert(true, "This will never trigger because it is true.");
        return {
            'should execute transaction': async () => {
                // Something should happen in this test.
            };
    }
};
```

### Understanding the Test Class

        <br />
        <br />
-   requiredUnlimitedSupply()
    -   Specifies whether system will use max supply when creating the system token.

### tests() class function

Tests usually passes a handful of useful objects from commonly used libraries like eosjs, eos-ecc, etc.

```js
tests({ assert, endpoint, cleos, rpc, api, ecc, keychain }) {
        assert(true, "This will never trigger because it is true.");
        return {
            'should execute transaction': async () => {
                // Something should happen in this test.
    };
}
```

-   `assert(condition, error_message)`
    -   Standard issue testing suite asserter.
        <br />
        <br />
-   `endpoint`
    -   The URL for the running nodeos (port might not always be 8888)
        <br />
        <br />
-   `cleos(command, options)`
    -   A helper method that will execute all [cleos commands](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/v2.2/cleos/index) fed to it.
    -   options is an object that takes the following properties:
        ```
        {
          swallow:boolean, // whether to swallow errors from this cleos command
          fetch:boolean // if true cleos will return the results, if false cleos will return a boolean based on success.
        }
        ```
-   `rpc` a standard `eosjs` rpc object ([Getting table information using eosjs](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosjs/v22.0/how-to-guides/how-to-get-table-information/?query=get_table_rows&page=1#get-table-rows))
    <br />
    <br />
-   `api` a standard `eosjs` api object ([Sending a transaction using eosjs](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosjs/#sending-a-transaction))
    <br />
    <br />
-   `ecc` a standard `eosjs-ecc` object ([Full documentation here](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosjs-ecc))
    <br />
    <br />
-   `common` a group of functions that are most commonly used for fetching `eosio` chain data, creating accounts, sending tokens, etc.
    -   See below.
-   `keychain`
    -   See below.

### keychain object

Ultratest follows a deterministic keys schema, where the keys for each account/permission will be exactly
the same each run. For example the key for `foo` will always be the same, but `bar` will be different from `foo`.

-   `generateAndReturnPublicKey(account:string): Promise<string>` \* This will return a public key which is created for this account, it will also inject that key into both eosjs and keosd for signing. You can specify `account@permission` in the `account` parameter.
    <br />
    <br />
-   `getAccountKeys(account:string): Array<string>|null`
    -   will return all available keys or null.
        <br />
        <br />
-   `setAccountKeys(account:string, key_object:EosjsKey): Promise<void>`
    -   will allow setting a private key for an account, and will also import it into eosjs and keosd. **Will not override!**. Must be a key object (eosjs).
        <br />
        <br />
-   `getAllPublicKeys(): Array<string>`
    -   Will get all available public keys.
        <br />
        <br />
-   `getPrivateKey(public_key:string): string|null`
    -   Will return any private key found matching this public key.
        <br />
        <br />
-   `getPublicKeyFromAccount(account:string): string|null`
    -   Will return a public key associated with an account.
        <br />
        <br />
-   `getPrivateKeyFromAccount(account:string): string|null`
    -   Will return a public key associated with an account.
        <br />
        <br />
-   `sign(signargs:object): Promise<{ signatures, serializedTransaction }>`
    -   Will sign a transaction following the `eosjs` signature provider format. Keys will be inferred from the authorizations & required keys.

## Writing a Simple Test

Below is an example of writing a simple test that checks the value of a global `eosio` table to ensure that it is a specific value. It also checks if the `eosio` account has been created.

```ts
module.exports = class test {
    constructor() {}

    requiredAccounts() {
        return ['annie'];
    }

    requiresSystemContracts() {
        return true;
    }

    tests({ assert, endpoint, cleos, rpc, api, ecc, keychain, common }) {
        return {
            'should perform an account lookup against eosio': async () => {
                const account = await common.getAccount('eosio');
                assert(account, "Account 'eosio' does not exist.");
            },
            'should perform an account lookup against annie': async () => {
                const account = await common.getAccount('eosio');
                assert(account, "Account 'eosio' does not exist.");
            },
            'should lookup eosio global table': async () => {
                const results = await common.getTable('eosio', 'eosio', 'global');
                assert(results[0] && result[0].ultra_veto_enabled, 'Table was found, and vote is enabled.');
            },
        };
    }
};
```

`assert` can be used in a handful of ways, but the most common way to write an `assert` is to check if a value is true or false.

## Common API

The `common` object inside of `tests` has a handful of useful functions that will speed up your test deployment time.

### getSingleton

Returns a single table object with what is presumed to be the table data inside of it.

**Usage**

```typescript
getSingleton(account: string, scope: string, table: string);
```

**Example**

```typescript
const result = common.getSingleton('eosio', 'eosio', 'global');

if (!result) {
    // No table exists or the function already errored out.
    return;

# Ultra Uniq Discord Bot

![](/images/discordbot/discordbot.png)

## What is the Discord Bot?

Ultra has created a Discord Bot which allows you to verify your Ultra Mainnet account, and then use Uniqs (NFTs) as keys which open access to gated channels. In short, if you have the right Uniq, you can have access to special content on a Discord server.

## Where do you get the Discord Bot?

Ultra provides both the [Github repository](https://github.com/ultraio/ultra-discord-uniq-roles-bot) for the Discord Bot, and the [Quay.io image](https://quay.io/repository/ultraio/discord-uniq-roles-bot?tab=tags).

## Summary of Use

-   An Administrator of the server will assign a factory to a discord role.
-   A user uses a command in your Discord Server to bind their Discord Account to the Ultra Blockchain.
-   A user will then receive a private message with a prefilled URL that points to a WebServer that this bot is running alongside itself.
-   The user will then visit the attached URL.
-   The user will either be prompted to connect to the Ultra Wallet extension, or obtain the Ultra Wallet Extension.
-   Upon connecting they will be asked to sign a message with their blockchain account.
-   A callback URL will be invoked back to this bot with the signed message.
-   We now have identified that the user owns the blockchain account and we can store that into a database.
    -   Stores the Discord ID
    -   Stores the Blockchain ID
    -   Stores the Signature
-   After the internal logic of the bot will lookup the blockchain id and bind roles to the discord user based on what Uniq's they own and have in their inventory.
-   If a matching token factory is found in the user's inventory they are given a discord role that matches it.
-   Perioidic updates are done to add / remove roles based on users who are stored in the Database.

# Installing the Client

This is where the HTML data lives, and includes all the necessary files for a small single page application.

This utilizes Vite to create a single page application that utilizes Vue.

## Commands

From the root directory of this monorepo; run any of the following commands.

### Vue Development Server

Spins up a localhost server to perform development. This spins up a Vite server on port 3000 (usually) and allows you to make changes and view them in your browser.

```sh
npm run vue-dev -w client
```

### Build

Builds the client-side into a single page application, and pushes it to the server folder under packages/server/dist/html.

```sh
npm run build -w client
```

## Folder Structure

This is a traditional Vite + Vue folder structure with TypeScript.

Everything is inside of the src directory.

---
title: 'Installing the Server'

outline: [0, 4]

# Installing the Server

This is where the backend data lives. This handles database writing, verifying signatures, and Discord commands.

## Commands

From the root directory of this monorepo; run any of the following commands.

### Dev

Spins up a localhost server to perform development against for the server-side.

```sh
npm run -w server
```

### Build

Builds the client-side into a single page application, and pushes it to the server folder under packages/server/dist/html.

```sh
npm run build -w server
```

## Folder Structure

The main logic lives inside of the `src/services` folder.

The bot will not start without starting every service successfully.

### services/blockchain

Handles various calls to the ultra main network chain

### services/database

Handles writing to a MongoDB collection for an individual user, or a token factory binding to a discord role

### services/discord

Handles all slash commands that are integrated with discord

### services/express

Handles feeding the compiled HTML static site to users who access the available endpoint that is provided by this bot

### services/messageProvider

Generates cached messages which are used to help identify a signature after a signature is signed by a blockchain account

### services/users

Handles refreshing user data and inventories and rebinding roles.

# Running the Bot

Depending on your environment and usecase you will want to use one of the following commands to start the bot.

## Production

Builds both Client & Server, then Starts the Bot.

HTML files are automatically built to `packages/server/dist/html`.

```sh
npm run start -ws
```

## Development

Use this if you are making changes.

Ultra Wallet requires an HTTP(s) server to work with it.

This starts a Vite Server with local https, and the server without feeding the built pages through the endpoint.

```sh
npm run dev -w packages/server
```

### Docker

These are general purpose docker instructions based off this repository.

Start by adding your `.env` file to `packages/server/.env`

Run the following to start the bot.

```sh
docker build -t uniqbot .
```

```sh
docker compose up
```

# Ultra EVM Quick Start
This quick start tutorial consists of three key parts:
1. **[Part 1: How to Get UOS in Ultra EVM](#part-1-how-to-get-uos-in-ultra-evm)**
2. **[Part 2: How to Send EVM Transactions in Ultra EVM](#part-2-how-to-send-evm-transactions-in-ultra-evm)**
3. **[Part 3: How to Bridge UOS Out of Ultra EVM](#part-3-how-to-bridge-uos-out-of-ultra-evm)**

## Part 1: How to Get UOS in Ultra EVM

UOS is the native currency on Ultra EVM. To execute any EVM transaction, you need UOS in your EVM address to cover gas fees. This tutorial guides you through bridging UOS from an Ultra account to an EVM address.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Ultra Account**

    -   If you already have an Ultra blockchain account with some UOS in it, you can easily bridge UOS to your EVM address.
    -   If you do not have an Ultra account, you can:
        -   Create one on the Ultra testnet and get some test UOS via the [account and token faucet](https://faucet.testnet.app.ultra.io/) (for testnet).
        -   Or install and register on the [Ultra platform](https://ultra.io/) and buy some UOS with the Ultra Wallet (on mainnet).
2.  **Ultra Wallet Extension**

    -   Install the [Ultra Wallet extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ultra-wallet/kjjebdkfeagdoogagbhepmbimaphnfln).
    -   This wallet extension can manage your UOS tokens and facilitate bridging to EVM addresses, more info can be seen in the [wallet extension doc](https://developers.ultra.io/products/ultra-wallet/).

### Method 1: Bridging UOS via cleos Command

Use the `cleos` command to transfer UOS to the `eosio.evmin` account, specifying the EVM address in the memo.

```bash
cleos -u https://test.ultra.eosusa.io push action eosio.token transfer '["1aa2aa3aa4lh", "eosio.evmin", "1.00000000 UOS", "0x53b4dfAC2114B47C27e3303d221Ede257cb8b495"]' -p 1aa2aa3aa4lh

```
Here:

-   **`1aa2aa3aa4lh`** is your Ultra account.
-   **`eosio.evmin`** is the contract account to which you send your UOS.
-   **`1.00000000 UOS`** is the amount of UOS to transfer.
-   **`0x53b4dfAC2114B47C27e3303d221Ede257cb8b495`** is the EVM address that will receive the bridged UOS.

### Method 2: Bridging UOS via Ultra Wallet Extension

#### Step 1: Log In to Ultra Wallet

Open the Ultra Wallet Extension. Log in using your Ultra account or private key pro account. Here I've used private key of the pro account `1aa2aa3aa4lh` for login.

![Wallet Login](./images/ultra-wallet-extension.png)

#### Step 2: Transfer UOS

After logging in, click the **Transfer** button. Fill Transfer Details
-  **Recipient**: `eosio.evmin`
-  **Amount**: Enter the UOS amount (e.g., `1.00000000 UOS`).
-  **Memo**: Specify the EVM address (e.g., `0x53b4dfAC2114B47C27e3303d221Ede257cb8b495`).

![Transfer Details](./images/transfer-2.png)

#### Step 3: Confirm Transfer

Review the details and confirm the transaction.

![Confirm Transfer](./images/transfer-3.png)

#### Step 4: Transaction Success

After the transaction completes, a success message will appear. That's it, you've bridged UOS into your evm address.

![Transfer Success](./images/transfer-4.png)

### Verifying the Bridge Transaction

#### Step 1: Check Ultra Blockchain Explorer

View the Ultra blockchain transaction on the Ultra Testnet Explorer: [https://explorer.testnet.ultra.io/tx/41ff40aa05ca8e6cb8837c374ebcfd29084df6eaa1fc9bebd5cee9d37ab8e31d](https://explorer.testnet.ultra.io/tx/41ff40aa05ca8e6cb8837c374ebcfd29084df6eaa1fc9bebd5cee9d37ab8e31d)

#### Step 2: Check EVM Transaction on Ultra EVM Explorer

View the EVM transaction on the Ultra EVM Testnet Explorer: [https://evmexplorer.testnet.ultra.io/tx/0xce3028b5cb846e85896233448eddd9ab6079039bd75afe2c63580e668011b031](https://evmexplorer.testnet.ultra.io/tx/0xce3028b5cb846e85896233448eddd9ab6079039bd75afe2c63580e668011b031)

### Checking EVM Balance

Use the `eth_getBalance` method via curl to check the UOS balance in your EVM address:

```bash
curl https://evm.test.ultra.eosusa.io \
-X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "eth_getBalance", "params": ["0x53b4dfAC2114B47C27e3303d221Ede257cb8b495", "latest"], "id": 1}' | jq .
```

**Example Response:**

```json
{
"id": 1,
"jsonrpc": "2.0",
"result": "0xa491c58c3fd14800"
}

```

### Checking Transaction Receipt

To verify the transaction receipt, use `eth_getTransactionReceipt`:

```bash
curl https://evm.test.ultra.eosusa.io \
-X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '[{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "eth_getTransactionReceipt", "params": ["0x1f206e9205361706dacc1351b30570a01a5dac0776a16b101fce7fe4ed4be43e"], "id": 1}]' | jq .
```

# Ultra EVM Fee Structure

This document provides an overview of the fees charged on the Ultra EVM for both **normal EVM transactions** and **bridge-in transactions**.

---

## 1. EVM Transactions (including bridge-out)

When sending a transaction from one EVM address to another (or bridging out), the fee structure is:

1. **Gas Fee**: `gas price * gas used`
2. **Distribution of Gas Fee**:
   - **10%** goes to the EVM miner.
   - **90%** goes to the EVM account (a system account designated to receive a portion of the fees).
3. **Charged On Top of Transaction Amount**  
   If you send **1 UOS** from `evm1` to `evm2`, you will pay the 1 UOS **plus** the gas fee.  

### Example

- **Transaction**: Send 1 UOS from `evm1` to `evm2`
- **Gas Used**: 21000 (example figure)
- **Gas Price**: 0.0000015 UOS/Unit (example figure)
- **Gas Fee**: 21000 * 0.0000015 = 0.0315 UOS
- **Total Charged to Sender**: `1 UOS + 0.0315 UOS = 1.0315 UOS`
- **Amount Received by Recipient**: `1 UOS`
- **Gas Fee Distribution**: 0.0315 UOS
  - 10% (0.00315 UOS) goes to EVM miner
  - 90% (0.02835 UOS) goes to EVM account

---

## 2. UOS Bridge-In Transactions

When bridging UOS from a non-EVM Ultra account into the EVM, a **fixed** bridge-in fee applies:

1. **Fixed Bridge-In Fee**: `0.1 UOS`
2. **No Other Fees**: No gas fee is charged on bridge-in; only the fixed fee is applied.
3. **Charged From Sent Amount**  
   If you send 1 UOS to the EVM, the receiving EVM address will get `1 UOS - 0.1 UOS = 0.9 UOS`.

### Example

- **Transaction**: Send 1 UOS from a **non-EVM** Ultra account (`account1`) to an EVM address (`evm1`)
- **Fixed Bridge-In Fee**: 0.1 UOS
- **Amount Received by Recipient**: `1 UOS - 0.1 UOS = 0.9 UOS`
- **Fee Recipient**: The 0.1 UOS fee goes to the EVM account

---

## Summary

- **EVM Transactions**:
  - Gas fee = `gas price * gas used`
  - 10% of gas fee → EVM miner
  - 90% of gas fee → EVM account
  - Gas fee is in addition to the sent amount

- **Bridge-In Transactions**:
  - Fixed fee = `0.1 UOS`
  - Deducted from the sent amount
  - Goes entirely to the EVM account

# How to log in to the Ultra Tool Kit using Ledger

Ultra Tool Kit is a decentralized application facilitating seamless interaction with the Ultra blockchain and its smart contracts. Designed for developers, it provides essential functionalities such as interacting with Ultra smart contracts, searching for Uniqs, Uniq Factories and Users.

This tutorial will cover the simplest process of logging in into the Ultra Tool Kit using a [Ledger Device](https://www.ledger.com).
Ledger devices are hardware crypto wallets that store your private keys offline.

## Prerequisites

-   You must have a [Ledger Device](https://www.ledger.com). For the sake of this tutorial, we are going to use a Ledger Nano X.
-   You must have already an account created via official [Ultra client](https://ultra.io/) or Ultra Wallet extension. Refer to the [How to create an Ultra Pro Wallet using Ultra Wallet Extension](../guides/how-to-create-ultra-pro-wallet.md) tutorial to create an account.
-   Your account must have sufficient UOS tokens for a new account creation transactions fees. Current Ultra Pro Wallet creation price is <OracleConversion :amount="2.0" scope="......2nf5.o4" :param="70000" />.

## Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to login into the Ultra Tool Kit using Ledger.

## Setting Up Ledger for EOS

1. Follow instructions provided with your Ledger device and ensure you install the companion [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live) application.
2. Once installed, connect your Ledger and open Ledger Live application. Navigate to `My Ledger` section from the sidebar and search for `EOS` application in the `App Catalog` section.
   ![](./images/ledger-search-eos-app.png)
3. Install the EOS application by clicking the `Install` button.
4. After you install the EOS application, you will need to go open the EOS application from your Ledger device and then head into settings, and set "Contract data" setting to be allowed.

   ![](./images/ledger2.jpg)
   ![](./images/ledger3.jpg)

## Getting Public Key from Ledger

Your ledger device comes with multiple public keys. Each public key is assigned an index value starting from `0`. For the sake of this tutorial, we will use the first public key (i.e; the public key at index `0`).

To obtain the public key of your Ledger, go to Ultra Tool Kit (https://toolkit.ultra.io), and
click on the `Login To Tool Kit` button to open a list of all supported login methods, and then select the `Ledger` option.

![](../fundamentals/images/toolkit-login-button.png)

# Airgrab Overview

## What we want

We want to use 3rd party quest systems to ask community to perform all kinds of actions such as: Follow user x, retweet tweet y, etc. Unfortunately, these quest systems such as Galxe, only support Ethereum accounts.

To solve this problem, we will collect the user's "Ethereum Wallet IDs" and the "points" they earned doing these quests and then publish them on Ultra.

Users can then link their Ethereum account using Ultra's Avatar system and claim their reward on the whitelisted air grab smart contract.

We want this smart contract to be usable by any third project on Ultra, making it a new infrastructure service.

## How a campaign works

- A manager will create a campaign with a unique name, a quantity of tokens as rewards, and the total number of campaign points. These campaign points will be used to calculate the rewards the user will get.

- The manager can whitelist users along with their points and add them to the existing campaign. The manager can only add a whitelisted user after the campaign is created and before the campaign is credited.

- The manager can credit the campaign by transferring the quantity of tokens to `ultra.rgrab` with the specific format memo which includes the campaign name, points, and deadline. For actual format and example, please refer to [on_transfer - To credit the campaign](../../blockchain/contracts/airgrab-contract/airgrab-actions/on_transfer.md)

- A user can claim the rewards after being added to the whitelist and the campaign is credited. When a user claims rewards, he can use his ultra wallet or any associated ether wallet, but the user needs to sign the transaction with his ultra wallet. No matter which wallet is used, the claim action will find all rewards belonging to the ultra wallet and its ETH wallets and send the rewards one by one.

- A manager can close a campaign after it expires and take back any rewards left.

## Usage of actions

-   [createcampgn - Create a new Airgrab Campaign](../../blockchain/contracts/airgrab-contract/airgrab-actions/createcampgn.md)
-   [whitelistusr - Whitelist users with specified points](../../blockchain/contracts/airgrab-contract/airgrab-actions/whitelistusr.md)
-   [claimrewards - Claim rewards from campaign](../../blockchain/contracts/airgrab-contract/airgrab-actions/claimrewards.md)
-   [closecampgn - Close and existing campaign](../../blockchain/contracts/airgrab-contract/airgrab-actions/closecampgn.md)

On notify action, which will be called after `eosio.token::transfer`
-   [on_transfer - To credit the campaign](../../blockchain/contracts/airgrab-contract/airgrab-actions/on_transfer.md)

## Benefits

- Allow token creator have more flexible policy with their token

# Development Environment Setup

Most convinent way to interact with a docker container and manage the files inside it is by using VS Code

## Local

For the local environment you just open `~/ultra_workdir` if you're on Linux or `C:\Users\Username\ultra_workdir` on Windows using VS Code. You can write all the tests and smart contract code locally. Then if you want to build and test use one of the following pathways:
- [VS Code extension](../../products/smart-contract-toolkit/index.md)
- [Run build commands in docker](./docker-contract-development-flow.md)

## Docker

Start a docker container using this [command](./docker-image-usage.md#running-the-image).
It'll start a container called `ultra` which you can connect to using VS Code.
By default your `ultra-workdir` is mounted to the `/opt/ultra_workdir` directory inside
the container so any changes in that directory will persist on your filesystem.
Go to the `Remote-Explorer` and attach to the `ultra` container.

![](/images/vscode-attach-to-container.png)

Once connected to the container open the terminal

![](/images/vscode-open-the-terminal.png)

and open the `/opt/ultra_workdir` directory inside the container

![](/images/vscode-select-ultra-workdir.png)

## VPS

To connect to your virtual machine using ssh go to `Remote-Explorer` and then select `SSH Targets`. Make sure the targets are available in your `~/.ssh/config`.

title: 'Docker Contract Development Flow'

# Docker Contract Development Flow

A smart contract is written in C++ but compiled into WASM.

Developers must have some knowledge in C++ to write smart contracts for the Ultra Blockchain.

## Hello World Smart Contract

Recommended to setup a [VS Code Environment](./development-environment.md) before moving forward.

### Setup

Create a directory called `hello` inside of any of the following directories:

-   Windows: `C:\\Users\\Username\\ultra_workdir\\hello`

-   Linux: `~/ultra_workdir/hello`

-   Docker Container: `/opt/ultra_workdir/hello`

_Additional permissions may be required to create the directory._

### Create hello.cpp

Navigate to the following directory.

```
cd /opt/ultra_workdir/hello
```

Create the file `hello.cpp` inside of the `hello` directory.

Then place the following content inside of `hello.cpp` and ensure you save the file.

```cpp
#include <eosio/eosio.hpp>
class [[eosio::contract]] hello : public eosio::contract {
  public:
      using eosio::contract::contract;
      [[eosio::action]]
      void hi( eosio::name user ) {
         print( "Hello, ", user);
      }
};
```

_Above is Content for `hello.cpp`_

## cdt-cpp binary

There is a single binary which is included with our docker image.

### What is it?

- A clang-based WASM compiler and ABI generator tool
- Must be ran anywhere inside of the docker image

### Usage

```
cdt-cpp -help
```

## Compiling a Smart Contract

Using the above `hello.cpp` file we can utilize `cdt-cpp` to compile it.

Run the following command **inside the docker image**.

```cpp
cdt-cpp hello.cpp
```

Three files should be created in the `hello` directory.

- hello.cpp
  - This is the source code of an example smart contract.
- hello.abi
  - This file describes the interface of the smart contract.
- hello.wasm
  - This is a compiled Web Assembly smart contract.

After compiling the smart contract there are two options for deployment in the local development environment.

- [Deploy with 'ultratest' framework](../../products/ultratest/index.md)
- ['cleos' based contract deployment](../../blockchain/general/tools/cleos.md#deploying-a-smart-contract)

## CMake

When building smart contracts, developers may have more than one file. While `cdt-cpp` provides the basics, it is recommended to use CMake for anything more complex than single file.

We will try compiling the `eosio.token` contract in this example.

### Preparations

Create a directory called `eosio.token` in one of the following locations:

-   Windows: `C:\\Users\\Username\\ultra_workdir\\eosio.token`

-   Linux: `~/ultra_workdir/eosio.token`

-   Docker Container: `/opt/ultra_workdir/eosio.token`

After creating the directory, create directories inside of `eosio.token` with the following paths:

- `eosio.token/include/eosio.token`
- `eosio.token/src`

Obtain the following files from [the following markdown page](../../examples/eosio.token.md) and append the content from each section in their own corresponding file.

### Example Folder Structure

```
/opt/ultra_workdir/eosio.token/
    |
    |- CMakeLists.txt
    |- include/
    |  |- eosio.token/
    |     |- eosio.token.hpp
    |- src/
        |- eosio.token.cpp
```

### Building using CMakeLists.txt

After preparing all the smart contract files and CMakeLists.txt you should be able to proceed with building the contract using the following commands:

```sh
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../
make
```

If you want to rebuild the contract you can either run the `make` command in the `build` directory again or delete the `build` directory and perform the commands above again

If everything is setup correctly the commands will use the `CMakeLists.txt` and build your contract.

![](/images/vscode-eosio-token-contract-build.png)

<br />

## Additional Files with CMake

CMake has a handful of functions that can be placed inside of a `CMakeLists.txt` file to include other files, and folders.

---

`target_include_directories(target PUBLIC dir_list)`

> Specifies include directories to use when compiling a given target.

**Example**

This example shows how to include other folders.

```
target_include_directories(mycontract 
    PUBLIC 
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include 
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/common/include 
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/mycontract_specific/include)
```

---

`add_contract`

>Used to build your smart contract and generate an ABI, the first parameter is the contract name, the second is the cmake target name, and the rest are the CPP files needed to build the contract.

**Example**

This example shows how to include additional `.cpp` source files.

```
add_contract(mycontract mycontract 
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/a.cpp 
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/b.cpp)
```

## Troubleshooting

Any errors encountered during builds or deployment can potentially have solutions in our [troubleshooting section](./troubleshooting.md).

title: 'Docker Image Usage'

order: -9997
outline: [0,4]
---

# Docker Image Usage

Pull the docker image down from quay.io

```sh
docker pull quay.io/ultra.io/3rdparty-devtools:latest
```

## Usage

We currently support Docker for a majority of our development needs as it allows most end-users to easily spin up our tools in almost any environment.

### Running the Image

```sh
docker run -dit --name ultra -p 8888:8888 -p 9876:9876 -v ~/ultra/ultra_workdir:/opt/ultra_workdir --name ultra quay.io/ultra.io/3rdparty-devtools:latest
```

* -d 
  * Run container in background and print container ID
* -i
  * Keep STDIN open even if not attached
* -t
  * Allocate a pseudo-TTY
* -p \[ HostPort:ContainerPort \]
  * A port range to expose for the Container
  * Port 8888 used as an HTTP port by `nodeos`
  * Port 9876 is used as P2P connection port by `nodeos`
* -v \[ HostPath:GuestPath \]
  * Attaches a directory from your host machine to the docker container

### Getting in the Image

If the above container name is kept as `ultra` then the following can be used to access the Docker Container.

```
docker start ultra && docker attach ultra
```

### Persisting container between runs

If you stick to commands specified under the `Docker` section of guides you should have your Docker container persist between runs. Commands such as `docker start` and `docker attach` will not destroy your existing container. Running the `docker run` command again with the same `ultra` container name will also not overwrite your container but instead will fail

Commands that may potentially remove your container (and erase the data inside it are): `docker rm`, `docker prune`. Please be sure to avoid them if you are concerned with your data being removed.

::: warning
When container is removed all changes you've done inside it will be erased. Because of that please ensure that your `ultra_workdir` is mounted to the container and move any files you want to keep to this `ultra_workdir`.

# Cleos Endpoint Usage

In many cases when working with smart contracts, or on-chain actions you will need an endpoint. An endpoint can be described as a URL to push transactions to, get chain information such as tables, or lookup accounts.

## Cleos Usage

Cleos has a section on using [external endpoints](../../products/chain-api/index.md).

In short append the `-u` flag with a url. If you are using local environment then this flag can be skipped. The default value of `http://127.0.0.1:8888` will be used

```
cleos -u <endpoint>
```

## cUrl Usage

cUrl can be used normally but suggested to use `json_pp` to help prettify the output from a cUrl response.

```
curl -X POST <endpoint>/v1/chain/get_info
```

## wget Usage

wget can also be used to fetch endpoint information as well.

```
wget -qO- /dev/stdout <endpoint>/v1/chain/get_info | json_pp
```

## Available Endpoints

[See this API section](../../products/chain-api/index.md) for information on block producer endpoints that are publicly available.

## Limitations and Availability

Each of these endpoints has their own policies and limitations on data that can be sent to and pull from the endpoint. However, those limitations are not easily understood. These are all public facing endpoints and if an API node is down, simply try another one.

# Tutorial - Install Docker and get started with Developer Tools Docker image

This tutorial will cover the simplest process of installing Docker and obtaining Developer Tools Docker image.

## Prerequisites

- No prerequisites

## Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to help you install Docker on your machine and get started with the Developer Tools Docker image provided by Ultra: obtaining and starting it; checking its contents.

## Install Docker on your current operating system

The first step is to get Docker installed on your machine. Please follow _one_ of the provided installation instructions below, appropriate to your operating system:

::: details Windows

**Install Docker on Windows**

1. Navigate to the [official Docker Desktop download page](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and click on the `Download for Windows` button.

![](./images/docker-windows-download.png)

2. Open the downloaded installer. You don't need to adjust any of the default settings, unless you want to. So can simply click on `Ok` and continue

![](./images/docker-windows-install.png)

3. After a successful installation and, possibly, a restart, you should be able to open the Docker application. When asked for agreement, you can review the agreement and click on `Accept`

![](./images/docker-windows-agreement.png)

4. You don't need to create an account to use Docker, so can skip the sign in step

![](./images/docker-windows-skip-sign-in.png)

5. Welcome Survey is also optional, you can skip it

![](./images/docker-windows-skip-survey.png)

6. Finally, make sure the `Engine running` is visible in the bottom left of the window and there is no error shown after reaching this window

![](./images/docker-windows-running.png)

**Validating Docker installation**

After installing and opening the Docker, open standard Windows Command Prompt. Enter the `docker run hello-world` command there and you should get the expected output:

![](./images/docker-windows-hello-world.png)

You likely want to clean up the created container, you will have no use for it and it will just clog the container list. To delete it, simply click on the garbage can icon next to the `hello-world` container:

![](./images/docker-windows-delete-hello-world.png)

:::

::: details Linux

**Install Docker on Linux**

Here we provide you with a list of commands that should get Docker installed and running on Ubuntu Linux version and its variants (e.g. Mint). If the provided commands do not work for you, we strongly suggest following the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

You can copy the whole code block section below and paste it into the terminal:

```sh
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

After running the previous set of commands, you should be able to install the actual Docker binaries and some of their dependencies. Use the following command to install them:

```sh
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

**Validating Docker installation**

To make sure Docker was installed correctly, try running the following command:

```sh
sudo docker run hello-world
```

If Docker was installed correctly, you should see the following output. Otherwise, please refer to [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for installation assistance.

![](./images/docker-linux-hello-world.png)

:::

:::: details macOS

**Install Docker on macOS**

::: warning

We don't officially support or provide assistance to Mac users at the moment, but the Docker image itself should function the same way regardless of the operating system and it should be possible to use it develop smart contracts and interact with the Ultra Blockchain on Mac.

:::

1. Navigate to the [official Docker Desktop download page](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and click on the `Download for Mac` button.

![](./images/docker-macos-download.png)

::: warning

Docker website may not properly detect the type of processor your Mac has, in case the version you've downloaded does not work stating that the `You can't open the application "Docker" because this application is not supported on this Mac`, try hovering over the arrow next to the `Download for Mac` button and select the other option for Mac (e.g. Intel Chip).

:::

2. Open the downloaded `.dmg` package

![](./images/docker-macos-downloads-dmg.png)

3. Do the standard drag and drop procedure

![](./images/docker-macos-install.png)

4. Now you should be able to simply open the Docker application from the Launchpad

![](./images/docker-macos-launchpad.png)

5. You will be likely asked if you want to open Docker. Simply agree to open it

![](./images/docker-macos-open.png)

6. After a successful installation you should be able to open the Docker application. When asked for agreement, you can review the agreement and click on `Accept`

![](./images/docker-windows-agreement.png)

7. When asked for configuration settings, you can just leave the recommended ones

![](./images/docker-macos-recommended-settings.png)

8. Finally, make sure the `Engine running` is visible in the bottom left of the window and there is no error shown after reaching this window

![](./images/docker-windows-running.png)

**Validating Docker installation**

After installing and opening the Docker, open the standard Terminal window (search for `Terminal` in the Launchpad). Enter the `docker run hello-world` command there and you should get the expected output:

![](./images/docker-macos-hello-world.png)

You likely want to clean up the created container, you will have no use for it and it will just clog the container list. To delete it, simply click on the garbage can icon next to the `hello-world` container:

![](./images/docker-windows-delete-hello-world.png)

::: info
After installing and opening the docker application, you should be able to follow the same usage instructions as for Linux.
:::

::::

## Obtaining the Docker image

After you have installed Docker on your machine, you should be able to pull the Docker image down from quay.io:

```sh
docker pull quay.io/ultra.io/3rdparty-devtools:latest
```

You will also want to use this command to update the Docker image you have locally.

The Docker image we provide is located at [our official quay.io repository](https://quay.io/ultra.io/3rdparty-devtools). If you are interested, you can check there to see if there is a new version of the image available, or use an older version if needed.

## Running the Developer Tools Docker image

To start the Docker container with the cloned Developer Tools Docker image use _one_ of the following commands appropriate for your operating system:

::: details Windows
```sh
docker run -dit --name ultra -p 8888:8888 -p 9876:9876 -v %cd%/ultra_workdir:/opt/ultra_workdir --name ultra quay.io/ultra.io/3rdparty-devtools:latest
```

You will be asked if you are okay with sharing the working directory with the Docker container. Only the content of the directory specified will be shared, and not any other content of your drive.

![](./images/docker-windows-allow-sharing.png)
:::

::: details Linux / macOS
```sh
docker run -dit --name ultra -p 8888:8888 -p 9876:9876 -v ~/ultra_workdir:/opt/ultra_workdir --name ultra quay.io/ultra.io/3rdparty-devtools:latest
```
:::

After you created the container you realistically won't need to create it again. Existing container will be accessible under the name of `ultra`.

::: info Side note
If you encounter an error: `Error response from daemon: Conflict. The container name "/ultra" is already in use`, then it means you already have the container running and don't need to do anything.
:::

::: warning
The above command will utilize ports 8888 and 9876. If those ports are occupied the docker will fail to create the container. In case you encounter this issue, make sure you don't already have a container running with those ports in use. Otherwise, you can adjust the first number in port publishing (e.g. `8889:8888` instead of `8888:8888`) or remove the port publishing arguments completely (e.g. `-p 8888:8888 -p 9876:9876`).
:::

To stop the container without destroying it you can use the following command. Stopping a container closes all running applications.

```sh
docker stop ultra
```

## Accessing the image

After you created the container you will be able to attach to it using the following command. It will also start the container if it is currently stopped.

```sh
docker start ultra && docker exec -it ultra /bin/bash
```

## What is included in the Docker image

- `cleos` - Basic utility for interacting with the Blockchain: reading table data, pushing transactions, generating keys. More details are available [here](../../blockchain/general/tools/cleos.md)
- `keosd` - Encrypted local-storage wallet. Used by `cleos` in case you sign or push transactions. More details are available [here](../../blockchain/general/tools/keosd.md)
- `nodeos` - Application that runs a Blockchain node: either a local node with a new chain, or connecting to an existing chain. More details are available [here](../../blockchain/general/tools/nodeos.md)
- `cdt-cpp` - Compiler for C++ EOS smart contracts. More details are available [here](../../blockchain/general/tools/cdt/index.md)
- `ultratest` - Testing utility for running JavaScript tests. More details are available [here](../../products/ultratest/index.md)
- Licenses - You can review the license for Docker image usage and accompanying tools at `/opt/license` inside the Docker image.

## Checking the versions of the provided tools

You can use the following commands to quickly find out the versions of various tools provided and to ensure they are present and can start without errors:

```sh
cleos version client
```

```sh
keosd --version
```

```sh
nodeos --version
```

```sh
cdt-cpp --version
```

```sh
ultratest --version
```

All commands provided will simply print their respective versions.

## Accessing Docker volume

The docker container has a shared directory located somewhere in your operating system:

-   Windows: `C:\Users\<Username>\ultra_workdir`

-   Linux / macOS : `~/ultra_workdir`

This directory will be linked to `/opt/ultra_workdir` inside the Docker container.

You can make sure it is working correctly by running the following command in the terminal that is attached to the Docker container:

```sh
touch /opt/ultra_workdir/hello_world.txt
```

After running the command, you should see the `hello_world.txt` in the directory appropriate for your operating system in the list above.

## Deleting a Docker container

If you want to update the version of the docker image used, or simply no longer need this Docker container, you can always delete it:

::: warning
This command deletes all the content of the Docker container. Only the files in `ultra_workdir` will be preserved
:::

```sh
docker stop ultra && docker rm /ultra
```

You can also use the Docker Desktop application to do so.

## What's Next?
The next tutorial will cover creating and compiling smart contracts using Developer Tools Docker image. You will learn how to set up your development environment, create a simple smart contract, compile it, and deploy it to the Ultra Blockchain. This step-by-step guide will provide you with the essential knowledge and tools needed to effectively develop and manage smart contracts within a Dockerized Ultra Blockchain environment. Refer to the [Tutorial - Creating and Compiling Smart Contracts with Docker](how-to-compile-smart-contract.md) for detailed instructions.

# Creating and Compiling Smart Contracts with Docker
This document guides you on how to create, compile, and deploy smart contracts using Ultra's 3rd party Docker image.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that Docker is installed on your computer and you can use the Developer Tools Docker image. For guidance, refer to the [Tutorial - Install Docker and get started with Developer Tools Docker image](getting-started.md) tutorial.

## Goal
The goal of this tutorial is to guide developers through the process of creating, compiling, and deploying smart contracts using Development Tools Docker image. By following this step-by-step guide, you will learn how to set up the development environment, create and compile a smart contract, deploy it to the Ultra Blockchain, and interact with it.

## Step 1: Start the Docker Container and Log In
Start the Docker container, which contains the smart contract developer tools and a local Ultra Blockchain, using the following command:

```sh
docker start ultra
```

Log in to your container with the following command:

```sh
docker exec -it ultra /bin/bash
```

## Step 2: Start the Local Chain in the Docker Container
Start the local Ultra Blockchain with:

```sh
ultratest -D -n -s
```
Accept the default recommendation for the temporary files location by pressing enter.

![](./images/compile-smart-contract-start-local-chain.png)

### Step 2a: Verify the Local Chain is Running
Execute the following command inside the container:

```sh
cleos get info
```

![](./images/compile-smart-contract-verfy-local-chain.png)

## Step 3: Create and Compile the Smart Contract
Create a directory on your **host** machine at `ultra_workdir/hello` and create a file named `hello.cpp` with the following content:

```cpp
#include <eosio/eosio.hpp>

class [[eosio::contract]] hello : public eosio::contract {
public:
using contract::contract;

[[eosio::action]]
void hi(eosio::name user) {
    eosio::print("Hello, ", user);
}
};
```

Save it, then compile it with the following command in your Docker session:

```sh
cdt-cpp -o /opt/ultra_workdir/hello/hello.wasm /opt/ultra_workdir/hello/hello.cpp
```
![](./images/compile-smart-contract-cdt-cpp.png)

Verify that two new files, hello.abi and hello.wasm, were created in the hello directory with the following command:

```sh
ls -lsa /opt/ultra_workdir/hello/
```
![](./images/compile-smart-contract-ls-lsa.png)


## Step 4: Create an Account for Deployment
Inside the Docker container, create a private and public key pair:

```sh
cleos create key --to-console
```

You will see a generated key pair:

```sh
Private key: 5KPNRT7C4CJs9ddNTieC5fL92NQNk82Nxb1EQ5sL4siGhU4oxcV
Public key: EOS7crhavXnYD6LcbfXQuF4GoqWsS8zdYvVXyv2AV9HSFLa75PHCD
```
Import the key into your local wallet:

```sh
cleos wallet import --private-key 5KPNRT7C4CJs9ddNTieC5fL92NQNk82Nxb1EQ5sL4siGhU4oxcV
```

Create an account named helloacc using your public key:
```sh
cleos system newaccount --gift-ram-kbytes 128 eosio helloacc EOS7crhavXnYD6LcbfXQuF4GoqWsS8zdYvVXyv2AV9HSFLa75PHCD EOS7crhavXnYD6LcbfXQuF4GoqWsS8zdYvVXyv2AV9HSFLa75PHCD
```

Verify the account:

```sh
cleos get account helloacc
```

![](./images/compile-smart-contract-helloacc.png)

## Step 5: Deploy the Smart Contract
Deploy the smart contract to helloacc:

```sh
cleos set contract helloacc /opt/ultra_workdir/hello hello.wasm hello.abi
```
::: warning
If you encounter the error account helloacc does not have KYC info, execute:

```sh
cleos push action eosio.kyc togglekyc '[]' -p ultra.kyc
```

Then retry the deployment command.
:::

Verify the deployment:

```sh
cleos get code helloacc
```

If the code hash is not zero, the contract has been successfully deployed.

## Step 6: Interact with Your Smart Contract
Call the hi action of the hello smart contract:

```sh
cleos push action helloacc hi '["alice"]' -p helloacc@active
```
The output will be "Hello, alice".

![](./images/compile-smart-contract-hello-alice.png)
Note: The hi action uses eosio::name parameter, so using capital letters will result in an Invalid name error:

```sh
cleos push action helloacc hi '["Alice"]' -p helloacc@active
```
Always use names that conform to the EOSIO naming rules: lowercase letters, digits, and periods, with a maximum length of 12 characters.

![](./images/compile-smart-contract-invalid-name.png)

## Step 7: Log Out from Docker Container
To log out from the Docker container, you can type `exit` or simply press the `CTRL+D` shortcut combination.

## What's next?

title: 'Obtaining Tokens Locally'

order: -9989
outline: [0,4]

# Obtaining Tokens Locally

Tokens can be obtained in one of two ways in the **local environment**.

The first way involves obtaining tokens in a unit test, check the [ultratest](../../products/ultratest/index.md#adduos) documentation for more information.

The second way involves an `ultratest` no test instance and `cleos`.

## Before the Transfer Action

You should be inside of the docker image.

You should have [ultratest running in a no-tests instance](../../products/ultratest/index.md#starting-a-system-node).

Make sure you have [created an account locally](../../blockchain/general/tools/cleos.md#creating-an-account) before running the following command.

## The Transfer Action

The chain should be ran locally through ultratest. 

You have all of the account keys for your own chain inside of `cleos`.

You can now perform a simple transfer action through the `eosio.token` contract.

```
cleos push action eosio.token transfer '["ultra.eosio", "someaccount", "5.00000000 UOS", ""]' -p ultra.eosio
```

_The above command transfers 5 UOS from `ultra.eosio` to `someaccount`.

# Troubleshooting Docker Image

General troubleshooting while working with the docker image and individual tools inside of the image.

## Smart Contract Debugging

If you are unable to determinne what the issue is inside of a smart contract we suggest the following methods.

**Rubber Ducky Debugging**

- Step through your code one at a time and read it back to yourself out loud.
- Ensure that it makes as much sense as possible as you read it out loud.
- Usually during the explanation page you can figure out where your error may be.

**Cave Man Debugging**

- Add various `eosio::print` statements inside of your smart contract.
- Print out every step of the way to help figure out where your smart contract may be failing.

**Test Based Debugging**

- Using the `ultratest` framework inside of the Docker image, you can write your own tests for a smart contract.
- This is very useful for debugging a smart contract that can already compile.

## Container is not starting

`Bind for 0.0.0.0:9876 failed: port is already allocated`

**Solution(s)**

Make sure there are no processes listening to ports `8888` and `9876`. They're used by the container.
To find the pid of the process listening to `PORT` on linux run `sudo lsof -i | grep PORT`,
on windows - `netstat -ano | findStr "PORT"`.

## Compiling smart contracts

```ini
error 2022-03-16T09:23:47.545 cleos     main.cpp:3985                 main                 ] Failed with error: Assert Exception (10)
!action_type.empty(): Unknown action <action_name> in contract hello
```

**Solution(s)**

Make sure the `<action_name>` is inside the abi file. If not check that it's marked with an `[[eosio::action]]` compiler attribute.

## Transaction Exceeding CPU Limit

```
Error 3080002: transaction exceeded the current network usage limit imposed on the transaction
```

**Solution(s)**

-    Improve the efficiency of your smart contract
-    Attempt to deploy the transaction multiple times
-    Find an HTTP endpoint for Testnet / Mainnet deployment that is very close to your network
-    Change transaction CPU Limits (Only applies to own networks)

## Authorization Error

```
Provided keys, permissions, and delays do not satisfy declared authorizations
```

**Solution(s)**

Revolves around specific private keys not currently available in your wallet that match the account permissions.

## No ABI or WASM Files

```
Error 3160010: No abi file found
```

```
Error 3160009: No wasm file found
```

**Solution(s)**

During the compilation of the smart contract it may not have compiled correctly. Try reviewing the compilation process and ensure that there are no additional errors showing inside of the console.


## Out of ram error

```
Reading WASM from /Users/shankar/contracts/hello/hello.wasm...
Publishing contract...
Error 3080001: Account using more than allotted RAM usage
Error Details:
account youraccname1 has insufficient ram; needs 25588 bytes has 9547 bytes
```

The state of a contract, along with the code and ABI are stored in a in-memory database.
Your storage quota is calculated based on the RAM resource.

**Solution(s)**
- Buy more ram using `buyram` action of the system contract
- Reduce your code size by not relying on 3rdparty libraries

# Tutorial - Generate a key and create a developer Testnet account

This tutorial will cover the simplest process of creating a developer account on Testnet to be used to interact with the blockchain.

## Prerequisites

-   No prerequisites

## Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to generate a unique key pair that will be used to create a new developer Testnet blockchain account. The account will later be used in later tutorials to demonstrate interaction with the blockchain.

## Generate a Key Pair

First we will generate a [private and public key](../../blockchain/general/antelope-ultra/public-and-private-keys.md). To do so use the form below and press the `Generate Key` button.

<KeyGenerator />

## Keep the keys safe

You will need both public and private key you've just generated in later tutorials. The public key (the one that starts with `EOS`) can be shared publicly with anyone. But the private key (begins with `5`) should be kept secret and not shared with anyone.

::: info

The simplest approach for now to keep your private key for later use would be to write it down on a piece of paper. It is not a good practice to store your private key openly in a text file on your machine.

:::

## Create Testnet account using Testnet Faucet

Please note that the images are for reference only. The key you generate and the account name you get will be different.

1. Visit this link to open our faucet application: https://faucet.testnet.app.ultra.io
2. Select `Account Creator` tab

![](./images/faucet-account-tab.png)

3. Paste your `Public Key` (the one that starts with `EOS`) in the `Owner Public Key` field

![](./images/faucet-account-key.png)

4. Fill the Captcha
5. Click `Create Account`
6. Write down the **Account Name** that was returned

![](./images/faucet-account-created.png)

## Lookup Your Account

Use the form below to lookup your account on our [Testnet Explorer](https://explorer.testnet.ultra.io/)

Verify that the public key listed under `Permissions` and the `Creation Date` are correct:

<LastPublicKey />

<TodaysDate />

&nbsp;

<AccountLookupTestnet />

1. **To add UOS tokens to your testnet account using the faucet**: The faucet is a tool that distributes free UOS tokens on the testnet, allowing you to perform transactions and interact with the blockchain without real financial cost.
2. **To purchase RAM for your account using `eosio::buyram`**: RAM in the EOS ecosystem is needed to store data on the blockchain. For example, if you want to store or manage digital assets like Uniqs, you need sufficient RAM. This tutorial will show you how to increase your RAM quota based on current prices and the amount of UOS you are willing to spend.

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to comfortably manage your resources on the Ultra blockchain, paving the way for more complex interactions such as deploying smart contracts or trading digital assets.

## Obtaining UOS Tokens Using the Faucet

This section will guide you through the process of obtaining UOS tokens on the Ultra testnet. This is crucial for performing transactions and interacting with various blockchain functionalities.

### Step 1: Check Initial Balance

Before obtaining additional UOS tokens, first check your current balance to verify the amount of UOS you have available. Visit the Ultra Blockchain Explorer at [https://explorer.testnet.ultra.io](https://explorer.testnet.ultra.io) and search for your account (e.g. `1aa2aa3aa4in`). In this example, the initial balance (e.g. 8.99999999 UOS) will be displayed. However, if you are accessing your account for the first time, the balance may be different, most likely 0 UOS.

![](./images/faucet-initial-uos-balance.png)

### Step 2: Open UOS Token Faucet Page

1. Open the faucet page at [https://faucet.testnet.app.ultra.io](https://faucet.testnet.app.ultra.io).
2. Select the `Token Faucet` tab on the page, as shown in the picture.

![](./images/faucet-token-faucet-tab.png)


### Step 3: Request UOS Tokens from the Faucet

1. In the `To account` field, enter your account name (`1aa2aa3aa4in`).
2. Click the `Issue` button to request the tokens. This interface may also show your initial balance as a reference, confirming the account to which the tokens will be issued.

![](./images/faucet-issue-tokens.png)

### Step 4: Confirm Token Issuance

After requesting the tokens:
1. You will be directed to a confirmation screen showing that 10 UOS tokens have been issued to your account.
2. Your new balance, combining previous funds with the newly issued tokens, should now read, for example, 18.99999999 UOS.

![](./images/faucet-token-issued.png)

### Step 5: Verify the Transaction

To ensure that the tokens were correctly added to your account:
1. Click on the `See in explorer` link provided on the confirmation page, or revisit the Ultra Blockchain Explorer.
2. Search for your account again to view the updated balance and confirm the transaction details, showing an increment of 10 UOS.

![](./images/faucet-verify-account-balance.png)

### Step 6: Check Account Balance

Finally, revisit the Ultra Blockchain Explorer to check your new account balance (e.g. 18.99999999 UOS).

![](./images/faucet-new-balance.png)

By following these steps, you have successfully added UOS tokens to your account using the faucet, enabling you to engage in further blockchain activities on the Ultra testnet.

## Buying RAM on the Ultra Testnet

This section explains how to use your UOS tokens to purchase RAM on the Ultra blockchain, which is necessary for storing objects and managing resources for your account.

### Step 1: Check Initial RAM Balance

Start by checking the initial RAM balance of your account to understand how much RAM you currently have. Navigate to the Ultra Blockchain Explorer at [https://explorer.testnet.ultra.io](https://explorer.testnet.ultra.io) and enter your account name (e.g. `1aa2aa3aa4in`) to view your RAM usage (e.g. 86 KB).

![](./images/buyram-initial-ram-balance.png)

### Step 2: Initiate RAM Purchase

1. Open the Ultra Tool Kit and select `Transaction Builder` from the left-hand menu.
2. Choose the `buyram` action under the `eosio` contracts to start the purchase process.

![](./images/buyram-action-builder.png)

### Step 3: Configure Buyram Action

Fill in the required fields for the `buyram` action:
- **Payer**: `1aa2aa3aa4in` (your account, who will pay for the RAM)
- **Receiver**: `1aa2aa3aa4in` (your account, who will receive the RAM)
- **Quantity**: `10.00000000 UOS` (the amount of UOS you want to spend on RAM)
- **Authorizer**: `1aa2aa3aa4in` (your account, authorizing the transaction)

![](./images/buyram-attributes.png)

### Step 4: Confirm the Transaction

Review the transaction details on the next screen. Ensure that all the information is correct before proceeding to confirm the transaction within the tool kit.

![](./images/buyram-confirm.png)

### Step 5: Confirm Transaction in Ultra Wallet

Next, confirm and authorize the transaction using the Ultra Wallet. This step is crucial as it secures the transaction on the blockchain.

![](./images/buyram-ultra-wallet-confirm.png)

### Step 6: Transaction Completion

Once the transaction is executed, a confirmation message stating `Transaction was completed successfully...` will appear. You can then verify the transaction details by clicking on `View in Explorer`.

![](./images/buyram-transaction-was-completed.png)

### Step 7: Verify the Transaction in Explorer

Check the blockchain explorer to confirm that 10 UOS was indeed spent from your account to purchase RAM. This verification ensures that the transaction was processed correctly.

![](./images/buyram-verify-transaction-in-explorer.png)

### Step 8: Check New RAM Balance

Finally, revisit the Ultra Blockchain Explorer to check your new RAM balance (e.g. 952 KB). You should see an increase in RAM, reflecting the purchase.

![](./images/buyram-new-ram-balance.png)

By following these steps, you have successfully used UOS tokens to purchase RAM for your account on the Ultra blockchain. This RAM is essential for activities such as deploying smart contracts or managing digital assets.

# Creating a Testnet Account

It's easy to create an account on our public Testnet. These accounts are used for interacting with smart contracts, or for deploying smart contracts to.

## Faucets

Ultra provides two types of faucets on our public Testnet.

-   `Account Faucet` - Here you can provide a public key and we will generate an account. Refer to [this tutorial](../../fundamentals/tutorial-generate-key-and-create-testnet-account.md) for details
-   `Token Faucet` - Here you can fund your Testnet account with some fake UOS for testing purposes. Refer to [this tutorial](../../fundamentals/tutorial-obtain-token-and-purchase-ram.md) for details

## Using your account with Ultra's Authenticator

We've put together a quick video that illustrates how to import your private key into the Ultra Authenticator.

# Creating a Wallet

This should only be done when you are **NOT** using `cleos` with `ultratest`. If you prefer to have Ultratest generate your accounts and wallets automatically, check the [start a local chain](start-local-chain.md) section for how to do so.

## Creating a Wallet

You can create a wallet with cleos using the command:

```sh
cleos wallet create --to-console
```

Alternatively, you can also output to a password file:

```sh
cleos wallet create --file <filename>
```

## Unlocking a Wallet

You can unlock your wallet with:

```sh
cleos wallet unlock
```

You'll be prompted to provide your password.

## Generating a Key Pair

Run the following command to generate a key pair:

```sh
cleos create key --to-console
```

This command will generate a new key pair and display the public and private keys on the console.

Make sure to securely store the generated private key as it will be needed for signing transactions.

Here's an example output of the cleos create key command:

```sh
Private key: `<private_key>`
Public key: `<public_key>`
```

Remember to keep your private key safe and secure. It's crucial to protect your private key from unauthorized access to prevent any potential misuse.

## Adding Keys to a Wallet

You must have your wallet open and unlocked. You'll need to generate a new key pair as is shown in the above section.

Run the following command to import the private key into your wallet:

```sh
cleos wallet import --private-key <private_key>
```

Make sure to keep your wallet secure and protect it with a strong password.

# Introduction

Ultra's blockchain is fast, easy to use, and friendly for developers. There are a few concepts that you as a developer will need to get to grips with so that you can successfully integrate our stack into your application.

Here will cover some of those basics that are necessary for working with the Ultra Blockchain.

## Prerequisites

You'll be running images that we provide inside of Docker, which instantiates VMs for use in development or production environments.

-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - Provided for free for Linux, Mac, and Windows

### Obtain Latest Image

Ultra does not provide direct access to our proprietary source code. Instead, we provide images which can be run in Docker. These images provide compiled versions of all the software you'll need to get up and running.

To obtain the latest image, pull the docker image down from quay.io

You can run this command in any Terminal or CLI application after installing [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

```sh
docker pull quay.io/ultra.io/3rdparty-devtools:latest
```

Depending on your internet connection, this may take a while to complete.

### Start Docker Container

After pulling the image down, you can start the container and access it by running the following command in any Terminal or CLI application.

```sh
docker run -it --name ultra -p 8888:8888 -p 9876:9876 quay.io/ultra.io/3rdparty-devtools
```

# Pushing Transactions

A transaction refers to a set of actions bundled together and submitted to the blockchain as a single atomic operation. It represents a unit of work or a state change that can be executed on the Ultra network. Transactions are fundamental to interacting with smart contracts and updating the blockchain state.

## Push a transaction with `cleos`

Open your terminal or command prompt.

The transaction command has the following structure:

```sh
cleos push transaction '
  {"actions":
    [
      {
        "account":"<contract_account>",
        "name":"<action_name>",
        "authorization":
          [
            {
              "actor":"<actor_account>",
              "permission":"<actor_permission>"
            }
          ],
        "data":<data_as_json_string>}
      ]
    }'
```

-   `<contract_account>`: The account associated with the contract where the action is defined.
-   `<action_name>`: The name of the action you want to invoke.
-   `<actor_account>`: The account that authorizes and signs the transaction.
-   `<actor_permission>`: The permission level of the actor account (e.g., "active").
-   `<data_as_json_string>`: The parameters or data for the action in JSON format. Ensure that you properly format the data according to the action's requirements.

Replace the placeholders `<contract_account>`, `<action_name>`, `<actor_account>`, `<actor_permission>`, and `<data_as_json_string>` with the actual values specific to your contract, action, and transaction data.

If the transaction is successful, you will receive a transaction ID as output. You can use this ID to verify the transaction's status on a block explorer.

## Transaction Format

On Ultra, transactions are formatted using JSON and consist of the following components:

Signatures are the cryptographic proof that an authorized account has approved and authorized the transaction. Signatures are generated using the private key corresponding to the account's public key.

Transactions can be optionally compressed using the zlib compression algorithm to reduce their size when transmitted over the network.

Packed Transaction: The packed transaction is the core component of the transaction format. It includes the following sub-components:

-   `expiration`: The expiration time of the transaction, represented as a timestamp. The transaction must be included in a block before this time to be considered valid.
-   `ref_block_num` and `ref_block_prefix`: These values refer to the block number and block prefix of a previous block. They are used for generating a unique identifier for the transaction and for ensuring that the transaction cannot be replayed on a different fork of the blockchain.
-   `max_net_usage_words` and `max_cpu_usage_ms`: These values represent the maximum allowed network and CPU usage for the transaction. The transaction's actions must consume resources within these limits to be accepted by the network.
-   `delay_sec`: An optional delay (in seconds) for scheduling the execution of the transaction.
-   `context_free_actions`: These are actions that do not require any context from the blockchain state. They can be executed in parallel and do not affect the transaction's authorization or signing.
-   `actions`: The main actions that define the intended operations to be performed on the blockchain. Each action includes the account, action name, authorization, and associated data.

Once the transaction is signed and ready for broadcasting, it is assigned a unique transaction ID. The ID is generated by hashing the packed transaction using the SHA-256 algorithm.

The use of JSON and cryptographic signatures ensures the integrity and authenticity of the transactions while facilitating interoperability with different tools and libraries.

# Start a Local Chain

Now that you have the [Docker image up and running](./index.md), we can move on to spinning up a local chain which you can use for development.

Inside your Docker image instance, you can start a local chain by running the following command that runs our test suite, Ultratest.

```sh
ultratest -D -n -s
```

Ultratest automatically sets up a wallet, keys, and all smart contracts. These are necessary to grant you access to the functionality necessary to develop on our stack.

A quick note on the flags above.

`-D` stops the `ultratest` framework from closing after tests have ran.

`-s` enables all system contracts

`-n` tells the program to not run any tests.

## Verifying Chain API is Started

Check `http://localhost:8888/v1/chain/get_info` to ensure that it is running.

When accessing the API externally use the URL `http://localhost:8888`.

# Using cleos

With `cleos`, developers and users can interact with Ultra's blockchain network by executing various commands. Some of the common operations that can be performed using cleos include:

-   Account management: Creating, modifying, and managing user accounts on the EOSIO blockchain.
-   Contract deployment: Compiling and deploying smart contracts onto the blockchain network.
-   Interacting with smart contracts: Sending actions to smart contracts and querying their state.
-   Transaction management: Creating, signing, and broadcasting transactions to the blockchain.
-   Blockchain data queries: Retrieving information about blocks, transactions, accounts, and other data on the blockchain.

By utilizing the `cleos` command-line tool, developers can automate interactions with Ultra's blockchain network, build DApps, and integrate web3 functionality into their applications.

These sections are written with the assumption that you have started a local chain with `ultratest`. See [Start Local Chain](./start-local-chain.md) for further information if you have not.

## Key Generation and Wallets

Ultratest comes with a `default` wallet which you can display with the command

```sh
more ~/ultratest/wallet.txt
```

To learn more about wallets and how to use them from the command line, we recommend that you [read through our section on Wallets](../../../blockchain/general/antelope-ultra/wallets.md).

The basic process is simply:

1. Generate keys
2. Create a wallet
3. Open the wallet
4. Unlock the wallet

Then you'll be able to use it to do things like creating accounts or signing transactions.

## Account Creation

Ultra has a [few different types of accounts](../../../blockchain/general/antelope-ultra/accounts-and-permissions.md) that are available for creation. In short, there are:

-   Ultra Accounts - These are created by the Ultra client on Mainnet and Testnet. They are non-custodial, recoverable accounts.
-   Ultra Pro Wallets - These are created by users and developers who wish to self-manage their keys.
-   Premium accounts - These are custom names reserved for Ultra and their partners.

For your local chain, you'll be creating an **Ultra Pro Wallet**. You can do so with the cleos command:

```sh
cleos push action eosio newnonebact '{"creator":"default", "owner":{"threshold":1,"keys":[{"key":"YOURPRIVATEKEY","weight":1}],"accounts":[],"waits":[]}, "active":{"threshold":1,"keys":[{"key":"PUBLICKEY","weight":1}],"accounts":[],"waits":[]}, "max_payment":"1.00000000 UOS"}' -p default
```

To perform the account creation transaction, you'll need to have enough UOS to cover the RAM cost associated with account creation.

## Transferring Tokens

Open and unlock your wallet.

To transfer tokens you run the command:

```sh
cleos push action eosio.token transfer '["myaccount", "recipientacc", "10.00000000 UOS", "Memo message"]' -p myaccount@active
```

## Publishing a Contract

Open and unlock your wallet.

To publish a contract you run the command:

```sh
cleos set code <account_name> <contract_wasm_file> -p <account_name>@active
```

## Tables

On Ultra, tables are a fundamental concept used for storing and organizing data within smart contracts. Tables act as a persistent data storage mechanism, allowing contracts to store, retrieve, and modify structured data on the blockchain.

Tables consist of rows and columns. Each row represents a record or an entry, and each column represents a field or a piece of data associated with that record.

They are commonly used to store various types of information, such as user accounts, token balances, transaction histories, game data, or any other structured data relevant to the contract's functionality. Contracts define their own custom tables, specifying the fields and their types. A table also includes an index, which allows for efficient querying and retrieval of data.

The data stored in tables is persistent on the blockchain. It remains available even after the execution of a contract's actions or transactions.

Smart contracts can read, modify, and delete data in tables. This allows for the creation of decentralized applications with complex business logic that can interact with and update the stored data.

Tables have a scope, which defines the context in which the data is stored. Each row in a table has a primary key, which is a unique identifier for that specific row. The combination of scope and primary key allows contracts to organize and retrieve data efficiently.

Tables can have one or more indexes defined on specific fields. Indexes enhance the performance of data retrieval by enabling faster search and filtering capabilities.

Storing data in tables consumes RAM resources on the EOSIO network. Contracts typically need to manage their RAM usage efficiently to avoid running out of resources.

### Reading Table Data with Cleos

To read table row data in EOSIO, you can use the EOSIO database API functions available within your smart contract.

#### Read the table row data

To read table row data using `cleos` on Ultra, you can use the get table command.

Here's how you can do it:

```sh
cleos get table <contract_account> <scope> <table_name>
```

-   `<contract_account>`: The EOSIO account associated with the smart contract containing the table.
-   `<scope>`: The scope or context in which the table data is stored. It determines the subset of data you want to retrieve.
-   `<table_name>`: The name of the table you want to read.

Replace `<contract_account>`, `<scope>`, and `<table_name>` with the actual values specific to your contract and table.

For example, if you want to read the accounts table of the eosio.token contract on the EOS mainnet, you can use the following command:

```sh
cleos get table eosio.token myaccount accounts
```

This command retrieves the table data for the `accounts` table in the `eosio.token` contract, scoped to the account `myaccount`.

The output will display the table row data in JSON format, including all the rows and their associated fields.

Note: The `get table` command retrieves the entire table, so it may take some time to display the output if the table has a large number of rows. If you only need specific rows or want to filter the results, you can use additional options like `--lower`, `--upper`, or `--index` with the `get table` command. Check the cleos documentation for more details on these options.

Using the `get table` command in cleos, you can conveniently retrieve and view table row data on the EOSIO blockchain without the need for direct smart contract interaction.

### Using Scope

When using `cleos` to interact with Ultra table data, you can specify the scope parameter to retrieve table data associated with a specific scope. Here's how you can use scope with `cleos` to query table data:

```sh
cleos get table <contract_account> <scope> <table_name>
```

-   `<contract_account>`: The EOSIO account associated with the smart contract containing the table.
-   `<scope>`: The scope or context in which the table data is stored. It determines the subset of data you want to retrieve.
-   `<table_name>`: The name of the table you want to query.

Replace `<contract_account>`, `<scope>`, and `<table_name>` with the actual values specific to your contract and table.

For example, if you want to retrieve the table data with a scope of "myaccount" from the `accounts` table of the `eosio.token` contract on the EOS mainnet, you can use the following command:

```sh
cleos get table eosio.token myaccount accounts
```

This command retrieves the table data for the `accounts` table in the `eosio.token` contract, specifically scoped to the account name "myaccount".

The output will display the table row data in JSON format, including all the rows and their associated fields that match the specified scope.

By providing the desired scope parameter in the `get table` command, you can retrieve table data associated with a specific scope using `cleos`. This allows you to access and view subsets of data within the table based on your defined scopes.

# Testnet Faucet Guide

Keys can be created in a variety of ways and through many different websites.

_We would never recommend using an external website for a Main Network keypair_

Anyway, here's a few websites you can do it on, or you can use [cleos](../../../blockchain/general/tools/cleos.md)

* [EOS Authority](https://eosauthority.com/generate_eos_private_key)
* [NadeJDE Key Generator](https://nadejde.github.io/eos-token-sale/)
* [EOSCafe Offline Generator](https://github.com/eoscafe/eos-key)

Next go to the https://faucet.testnet.app.ultra.io/ and paste public key into the form as shown below

![](/images/faucet-create-account-1.png)

Click on Create Account

![](/images/faucet-create-account-2.png)

Make sure the account was created

```sh
cleos -u https://ultratest-api.eoseoul.io get account 1aa2aa3aa4ae
```

## Claiming tokens

Once you created an account click on the `Token Faucet` tab and insert your account name in the form.

![](/images/faucet-issue-tokens-1.png)

Click on issue and you should get 10 UOS

# How to buy UOS tokens on Ultra Mainnet using the Ultra Wallet

This guide will guide you through the process of purchasing UOS tokens on Ultra Mainnet using the Ultra Wallet extension. UOS is the native token of the Ultra Network, and having it enables you to participate in various activities within the Ultra ecosystem.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have completed the following steps:
- **Wallet Setup**: You must have the Ultra Wallet extension installed and set up in your browser. If you haven't done this yet, please refer to our tutorial on [Setting Up the Ultra Wallet](../fundamentals/tutorial-setup-the-wallet.md). Note that you must select `Mainnet` environment and log in using your Mainnet account (either Ultra Account or Ultra Pro Wallet).
- **Account Creation**: Account created using official [Ultra client](https://ultra.io/) or Wallet Extension. You need to have an Ultra account linked to your wallet. For details refer to [Account Creation Guide](./how-to-create-ultra-pro-wallet.md).

## Step 1: Open the Ultra Wallet Extension

Begin by opening the Ultra Wallet extension in your browser. This is where all your transactions for buying UOS will initiate.

![](./images/buying-UOS-open-wallet-extension.png)

## Step 2: Initiate Purchase

Click on the 'Buy UOS' button within the Ultra Wallet interface to start the purchasing process.

![](./images/buying-UOS-ultra-wallet.png)

### Step 2a: Alternative Method - Purchasing UOS via the Ultra Client

Alternatively, you can also purchase UOS tokens directly through the Ultra Client. Simply navigate to your wallet screen within the Ultra Client and click on the `Buy UOS coins` button. This method provides another convenient option for acquiring UOS tokens.

![](./images/buying-UOS-ultra-client.png)

## Step 3: Acknowledge the Disclaimer

Upon clicking `Buy UOS`, you will be presented with a disclaimer page. It's important to read and understand this as it informs you that you are leaving the site managed by Ultra to a third-party website. Ultra does not control the quality, content, reliability, or security of the third-party website.

![](./images/buying-UOS-disclaimer.png)

## Step 4: Specify Purchase Amount

On the wallet application page, you need to specify how much UOS you want to buy. Note: The minimum transaction amount must be equivalent to at least $50, and the maximum is $20,000. For example, if you decide to buy 500 UOS, it might cost approximately $86.14. Click `Continue` after entering your desired amount.

![](./images/buying-UOS-wallet-app.png)

## Step 5: Choose Payment Method

Next, choose your preferred payment method from the options available, which could include credit cards, bank transfers, or other payment services. Select your option, then click `Continue`.

![](./images/buying-UOS-choose-payment-method.png)

## Step 6: Enter Payment Details

Enter your payment details on the provided form. This usually requires entering your credit card information. Double-check all details for accuracy before clicking the `Next` button to complete your purchase.

![](./images/buying-UOS-card-information.png)

## Conclusion

Once you have completed these steps, your transaction will be processed, and the UOS tokens will be credited to your wallet. Always verify the transaction within your wallet and check your new UOS balance to ensure the purchase was successful.

# How to create an Ultra Pro Wallet using Ultra Tool Kit

This tutorial will cover the simplest process of creating a developer account on Mainnet to be used to interact with the blockchain using the Ultra Tool Kit.

## Prerequisites

-   Account created using official [Ultra client](https://ultra.io/) or you can create it later during the tutorial using the Wallet Extension
-   Installed the [Ultra Wallet Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ultra-wallet/kjjebdkfeagdoogagbhepmbimaphnfln). Simply click `Add to` on the extension page
-   Your account must have sufficient UOS tokens for transactions and fees. Current Ultra Pro Wallet creation price is <OracleConversion :amount="2.0" scope="......2nf5.o4" :param="70000" />. This tutorial will briefly cover how to get UOS on Mainnet but if you already have some then you will be able to skip that step

## Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to create a new developer Ultra Pro Wallet on Mainnet, using the Ultra Tool Kit. You can use your Ultra Pro Wallet to directly interact with the blockchain. It is desireable for developers as it provides a more granular control over your account and allows it to be easily used for other tools and libraries like `cleos` or `Wharfkit`.

## Open and log in to the Ultra Wallet

To be able to create an Ultra Pro Wallet on Mainnet you will need to open your Wallet Extension and make sure you are switched to Mainnet. (You may need to log out from your Testnet account if it is currently logged in by clicking on the circular icon and clicking `Log out`).

![](./images/UltraProWallet/wallet-mainnet-selection.png)

Now if you already have an Ultra Account (created using the Ultra client) then you can simply use the `Sign In` option. If you don't have an account yet and need to create an account then proceed with `Sign Up` option, after signing up return back to this step and now use the `Sign In` option.

## Buy UOS tokens

To be able to create an Ultra Pro Wallet you will need some UOS available on your Ultra Account. The current Ultra Pro Wallet creation price is 2 USD which is approximately <OracleConversion :amount="2.0" scope="......2nf5.o4" :param="70000" /> so you need to have at least this amount of UOS and, preferably, a bit more to account for UOS price fluctuations.

If you don't have the required amount yet then you can utilize the `Buy UOS` option of the Ultra Wallet extension.

![](./images/UltraProWallet/wallet-buy-uos.png)

When you have enough funds you can proceed with the creation of the Ultra Pro Wallet.

## Generate a Key Pair

You will need a [private and public key pair](../../blockchain/general/antelope-ultra/public-and-private-keys.md) in order to create your Ultra Pro Wallet. If you already have a key pair, you can skip this step, or you can generate a new one using the form below by pressing the `Generate Key` button.

::: warning

In most cases we don't recommend generating private keys online. Please seek out some of the [alternative ways](../../blockchain/general/antelope-ultra/public-and-private-keys.md#alternative-ways-to-generate-keypairs) to generate a key pair safely.

It is up to you to properly secure your private key and not to lose it. If you lose the original copy of the private key you may eventually lose access to your new Ultra Pro Wallet account completely.

:::

<KeyGenerator />
\
\
Once you have your key pair, you can proceed with the creation of the Ultra Pro Wallet.

## Log in to the Ultra Tool Kit

Log in to the Ultra Tool Kit (https://toolkit.ultra.io) using your Ultra Wallet extension. Refer to [Log in to the Ultra Tool Kit Tutorial](../fundamentals/tutorial-login-to-toolkit.md) if you need help logging into the Ultra Tool Kit.

Once logged in, make sure you have selected `Mainnet` endpoint in the Ultra Tool Kit.

![](./images/select-network-mainnet-toolkit.png)

## Create an Ultra Pro Wallet

1. Once logged in to the tool kit, click on `Transaction Builder` from the Ultra Tool Kit sidebar menu to open the transaction builder page.

![](./images/toolkit-tx-builder.png)

2. On the transaction builder page, click on the `eosio` contract button to load all related actions.

![](./images/toolkit-tx-builder-select-contract.png)

3. From the list of actions, search for `newnonebact` and click on `eosio::newnonebact` option.

![](./images/toolkit-tx-builder-select-action.png)

4. Clicking on the `eosio::newnonebact` option will open up the transaction modal.

5. Fill the required fields for the `newnonebact` action.
    1. **creator**: `aa1aa2aa3ai4` (your existing Ultra Account, who will pay the account creation fee)
    2. Under `owner` section:
        1. **threshold**: Input `1` as the threshold for owner authority.
        2. Click on the `Add` button for `keys` section and enter your public key in the **key** input, and `1` in the **weight** input.
    3. Under `active` section:
        1. **threshold**: Input `1` as the threshold for active authority.
        2. Click on the `Add` button for `keys` section and enter your public key in the **key** input, and `1` in the **weight** input.
    4. **max_payment**: You need to specify the maximum amount of UOS you are willing to pay to create the Ultra Pro Wallet. The current Ultra Pro Wallet creation price is 2 USD which is approximately <OracleConversion :amount="2.0" scope="......2nf5.o4" :param="70000" /> so you need to input at least this amount of UOS and, preferably, a bit more to account for UOS price fluctuations (e.g. increase the current price by 1 UOS).
    5. Once you have inputted all the values, click on the `Send 1 Action` button.

![](./images/toolkit-newnonebact-form.png)

6. Clicking on the `Send 1 Action` button will open up the transaction confirmation modal. You can click on the `Details` button to view the transaction in JSON form. Click on the `Confirm` button to submit your transaction.

![](./images/toolkit-newnonebact-confirmation-form.png)

7. Confirm and sign the transaction using the Ultra Wallet extension. This step is crucial as it authorizes the blockchain to execute the transfer under your account.

![](./images/ultra-wallet-confirm-tx.png)

8. After signing the transaction, you will see a confirmation screen indicating that the transaction was successfully completed. To check the transaction on the block explorer, click on the `View in Explorer` text. Your new Ultra Pro Wallet name will be listed in the actions list.

![](./images/toolkit-tx-success.png)
![](./images/explorer-account-created.png)

For more information on the action, please refer to the [`newnonebact` action documentation](../../blockchain/contracts/system-contract/system-actions/newnonebact.md).

## Sign In to the Ultra Wallet using Ultra Pro Wallet

The process of using your new Ultra Pro Wallet through the Ultra Wallet extension is identical to the [Tutorial - Setup Ultra Wallet](../fundamentals/tutorial-setup-the-wallet.md). The only exception is if you wish to continue using the `Mainnet` network when logging into the Wallet, as the Ultra Pro Wallet you've just made is exclusively for Mainnet.

When you have enough funds you can proceed with the creation of the Ultra Pro Wallet. For this you need to click on the profile icon and select the `Create an Ultra Pro Wallet` button.

![](./images/UltraProWallet/wallet-create-pro-wallet.png)

This will open a new browser tab where you will have 2 options:

-   Generate a new private and public key pair
-   Use an existing pair to create an Ultra Pro Wallet

![](./images/UltraProWallet/wallet-generate-or-paste-public-key.png)

The simplest option is to generate a new key pair using the `Generate` button. Pressing it will automatically fill out the `Public key` field and will show you the associated private key

![](./images/UltraProWallet/wallet-private-key-shown.png)

::: warning

It is up to you to properly secure your private key and not to lose it. If you lose the original copy of the private key you may eventually lose access to your new Ultra Pro Wallet account completely.

:::

Before finishing the Ultra Pro Wallet creation you need to specify the maximum amount of UOS your are willing to pay to create it. The price fluctuates over time due to USD to UOS conversion fluctuations and may be a bit different then the estimate shown on the page. Pick a value that is a bit over the estimated price or just put a large number there, we will charge only the current equivalent of 2 USD converted to UOS.

![](./images/UltraProWallet/wallet-fill-optional-fields.png)

Now you can press the `Create Account` button to proceed. You will be prompted to approve the transaction with its details listed. Check it and click `Confirm`

![](./images/UltraProWallet/wallet-approve-transaction.png)

If everything was done correctly you will get a successful transaction screen. You can click on `Block Explorer` button to view the transaction status.

![](./images/UltraProWallet/wallet-transaction-successful.png)

Your new Ultra Pro Wallet name will be listed in the actions list. You cannot chose a name directly.

title: 'How to make a REST Request'

# How to make a REST Request

A REST request is a way to interact with a web service or in our case the blockchain, using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform actions on resources identified by URIs. It follows the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) for stateless communication.

## Why would I need to do this?

You may need to perform a REST request if you're looking up user balance, user account data, or maybe even NFTs.

## REST API Basics

Observe the following URL:

```
http://ultra.api.eosnation.io/v1/chain/get_info
```

It is composed of two parts:

```
<block_producer_url><endpoint>
```

Block Producer URL: `http://ultra.api.eosnation.io`

Endpoint: `/v1/chain/get_info`

Knowing this we can make a simple REST request.

## Making the Request

Use a CLI, or write some code in the language of your choice.

::: code-group

```sh [curl]
curl http://ultra.api.eosnation.io/v1/chain/get_info
```

```js [JavaScript]
const options = {method: 'GET', headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}, body: 'false'};

fetch('http://ultra.api.eosnation.io/v1/chain/get_info', options)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(response => console.log(response))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

```C# [C#]
var client = new RestClient("http://ultra.api.eosnation.io/v1/chain/get_info");
var request = new RestRequest(Method.GET);
request.AddHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
IRestResponse response = client.Execute(request);
```

```GO [Go]
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
	"io/ioutil"
)

func main() {

	url := "http://ultra.api.eosnation.io/v1/chain/get_info"

	req, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", url, nil)

	req.Header.Add("Content-Type", "application/json")

	res, _ := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)

	defer res.Body.Close()
	body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(res.Body)

	fmt.Println(res)
	fmt.Println(string(body))

}
```

```Java [Java]
HttpResponse<String> response = Unirest.get("http://ultra.api.eosnation.io/v1/chain/get_info")
  .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
  .asString();

# How to read the Block Explorer

A block explorer is a web tool that allows users to view information about cryptocurrency transactions and blockchain data. It provides details such as transaction history, wallet balances, and block information, enhancing transparency and accountability.

## Our Explorers

* [Main Network](https://explorer.mainnet.ultra.io/)
* [Test Network (You probably want this one)](https://explorer.testnet.ultra.io/)

## Usage

In most cases the search bar at the top takes any of the following:

* Account Name
* Transaction ID
* Block Number

### Example Queries

::: details Examples

```
account:eosio.token 

receiver:eosio.token (data.from:eoscanadacom OR data.to:eoscanadacom)

(auth:eoscanadacom OR receiver:eoscanadacom)

account:eosio.token action:transfer

(ram.consumed:eoscanadacom OR ram.released:eoscanadacom)

receiver:eosio.token 

db.table:global
```

Examples pulled from [dFuse Docs](https://docs.dfuse.eosnation.io/eosio/public-apis/reference/search/terms/)
:::

## Account Page


### Account Balance

Account balance is available at the top.

![](./images/block-explorer/explorer-balance.png)

### RAM & Power

Both of these are available on the account page as well.

`∞` means the account has no limitations. Otherwise, most accounts have a limitation.

Storing data on-chain costs `RAM`.

Executing transactions utilizes `POWER`.

![](./images/block-explorer/explorer-costs.png)

### Permissions

You can see who owns an account, or what key has control over an account under the `permissions` section.

The +1/1 shows how many signatures are necessary to act on behalf of a `permission`. Permission being `active` or `owner` in the example below.

![](./images/block-explorer/explorer-permissions.png)

In the example below the `tech` `permission` requires two users to a transaction to act on behalf of the `ultra@tech` account.

![](./images/block-explorer/explorer-permissions-advanced.png)

### Contracts

When you are on an account page such as `eosio.token` you can see that it has a contract deployed because it has the `tables` and `ABI` tabs.

![](./images/block-explorer/explorer-abi.png)

### Tables

Tables can be browsed for additional information if you're aware of how the table is structured. In the case of `eosio.nft.ft` I can view the `factory.b` table to see available Uniqs. Tables available can be gathered from the `abi` tab.

It's highly recommended to use `curl` requests against [REST API Endpoints](./how-to-make-a-rest-request.md) when reading data, or write a small script in one of your favorite programming languages.

# How to get UOS conversion rate

Oracle contract allows to retrieve USD to UOS conversion rates from the chain or utilize it in your smart contract to perform the necessary logic. This tutorial will explain those two use cases and provide examples on how to get the conversion rate.

To see details about the way oracle calculates the conversion rate and moving averages see [this page](../../blockchain/contracts/oracle-contract/how-does-oracle-contract-calculate-uos-conversion-rate.md)

## General layout of the oracle data

For broader overview visit [oracle tables structure page](../../blockchain/contracts/oracle-contract/oracle-tables.md)

When working with oracle you will most likely be interested in one of the 3 following tables:
- [`finalaverage`](../../blockchain/contracts/oracle-contract/oracle-tables.md#finalaverage)
- [`lastknwnrate`](../../blockchain/contracts/oracle-contract/oracle-tables.md#lastknwnrate)
- [`finalrates`](../../blockchain/contracts/oracle-contract/oracle-tables.md#finalrates)

### Using finalaverage

`finalaverage` should be used in case you want to utilize one of the available moving averages already calculated by the oracle contract. For the list of available moving averages see: [for seconds](https://explorer.mainnet.ultra.io/account/eosio.oracle/tables?scope=SECONDS&tableName=finalaverage), [for minutes](https://explorer.mainnet.ultra.io/account/eosio.oracle/tables?scope=MINUTES&tableName=finalaverage), [for hours](https://explorer.mainnet.ultra.io/account/eosio.oracle/tables?scope=HOURS&tableName=finalaverage), [for days](https://explorer.mainnet.ultra.io/account/eosio.oracle/tables?scope=SECONDS&tableName=finalaverage).

To know the actual window utilized by moving averages in the data you see you need to take the `Param` value (e.g. 600000) and divide it by 10000 (so 60). And if then check the scope you used to find this moving average (e.g. `MINUTES`). So in the example provided it means the moving average is calculated over the window of 60 minutes.

When you've found the moving average you are interested in then just utilize the `average` field stored in the table to get USD to UOS conversion rate (denoted as DUOS symbol) and the associated timestamp.

### Using lastknwnrate

`lastknwnrate` stores a single latest rate received by the oracle contract. It can be useful in case you want to have a quick reference regarding the conversion rate and don't specifically want to know the average over a period of time or look through all the possible exchange that are pushing the rates.

[View in block explorer](https://explorer.mainnet.ultra.io/account/eosio.oracle/tables?scope=eosio.oracle&tableName=lastknwnrate)

### Using finalrates

`finalrates` contains some of the historical information about the conversion rates and it is useful in case you need the previous values for 1 minute, 1 hour or 1 day moving average.

The scope used for `finalrates` table determines the unit of time you are looking at: [1 - minutes](https://explorer.mainnet.ultra.io/account/eosio.oracle/tables?scope=1&tableName=finalrates), [2 - hours](https://explorer.mainnet.ultra.io/account/eosio.oracle/tables?scope=2&tableName=finalrates), [3 - days](https://explorer.mainnet.ultra.io/account/eosio.oracle/tables?scope=1&tableName=finalrates).

Then you can utilize the `rates` field to get the UOS conversion rate. Note that to convert the `price` stored here you will need to divide it by 100000000 (8 zeros). For minutes scope the `rates` are stored in intervals of 60 seconds (so it is an average over the past 60 seconds as well), for hours scope - 60 minutes, for days scope - 24 hours.

## Get conversion rate using cleos (and jq for parsing)

For `finalaverage` table (can use `SECONDS`, `MINUTES`, `HOURS`, `DAYS`)

```bash
cleos -u https://ultra.api.eosnation.io get table eosio.oracle MINUTES finalaverage | jq '.rows[0].average.price'
```

For `lastknwnrate` table

```bash
cleos -u https://ultra.api.eosnation.io get table eosio.oracle eosio.oracle lastknwnrate | jq '.rows[0].latest_rate.price'
```

For `finalrates` table (can use 1, 2 or 3)

```bash
cleos -u https://ultra.api.eosnation.io get table eosio.oracle 1 finalrates | jq '.rows[0].rates'
```

## Get conversion rate using Wharfkit

For `finalaverage` table. Since Wharfkit does not properly support `time_symbol` as a scope you will need to use values converted to a `name` type. Refer to [this page](../../blockchain/contracts/oracle-contract/oracle-tables.md#finalaverage) for the list of scopes.

```ts
const contract = await kit.load("eosio.oracle")
const rows = await contract.table("finalaverage").query({scope:".1doep2pdt4oh"}).next()
```

For `lastknwnrate` table

```ts
const contract = await kit.load("eosio.oracle")
const rows = await contract.table("lastknwnrate").query().all()
```

For `finalrates` table (can use 1, 2 or 3)

```ts
const contract = await kit.load("eosio.oracle")
const rows = await contract.table("finalrates").query({scope:1}).next()
```

## Get conversion rate using HTTP

For `finalaverage` table (can use `SECONDS`, `MINUTES`, `HOURS`, `DAYS`)

```js
const rows = await fetch(`https://ultra.api.eosnation.io/v1/chain/get_table_rows`, {
    method:"POST",
    body:JSON.stringify({
        json: true,
        code: 'eosio.oracle',
        table: 'finalaverage',
        scope: 'MINUTES'
    })
}).then(x => x.json());
```

For `lastknwnrate` table

```js
const rows = await fetch(`https://ultra.api.eosnation.io/v1/chain/get_table_rows`, {
    method:"POST",
    body:JSON.stringify({
        json: true,
        code: 'eosio.oracle',
        table: 'lastknwnrate',
        scope: 'eosio.oracle'
    })
}).then(x => x.json());
```

For `finalrates` table (can use 1, 2 or 3)

```js
const rows = await fetch(`https://ultra.api.eosnation.io/v1/chain/get_table_rows`, {
    method:"POST",
    body:JSON.stringify({
        json: true,
        code: 'eosio.oracle',
        table: 'finalrates',
        scope: 1
    })
}).then(x => x.json());
```

# How to validate and refresh moving average

Conversion rates received from the oracle have a timestamp associated with them. It is important to always validate that timestamp to make sure the rates are not outdated and represent a reasonable up-to-date conversion rate.

## When the moving average can be considered valid

Depending on your business use case you may consider different conditions for when to consider the moving average valid or not. The two key metrics you could utilize are as follows:
- Timestamp of the moving average (or a conversion rate)
- Number of samples used to calculate the specific moving average

For timestamp you must be cautious of the fact that oracle updates conversion rates and moving averages only at the end of the minute / hour or day. For seconds level moving average there is a manual trigger explained in the next section. This means that if you look at the 1 minute moving average it will be updated once a minute, 60 minutes moving average - also once a minute (note that oracle makes a distinction here between 60 minutes and 1 hour), 1 hour moving average - once an hour.

Simple guideline for timestamp you could follow is to double the unit of time used by the moving average (e.g. 2 minutes, 2 hours or 2 days). NFT contract for example allows moving averages to be up to 30 minutes old.

Property `moving_window_counter` inside moving average data structure stores the number of entries used to calculate the moving average. If you compare it against the expected number (divide `param` of the moving average by 10000 to get the expected window size) you should be able to have a metric to determine if there were any gaps in the conversion rates stream. Note that this property may change over time so we advise it to only use as a reference and not as a strict value to build the rules around.

## Updating seconds level moving average

For details on using the action see [`calcsecma`](../../blockchain/contracts/oracle-contract/oracle-actions/calcsecma.md)

During normal oracle operation the moving average at the seconds level is not updated automatically and no Ultra smart contract is currently relying on them. You can manually issue the `calcsecma` from any account you have to recalculate them (thus updating the conversion rate and the timestamp inside `finalaverage` table).

Moving averages located at other scopes of the `finalaverage` table are updated automatically when new rates appear in the oracle. There is no need or way for you to update them yourself.

In case the moving averages provided are not enough please give us a feedback using the [feedback form](../../feedback/index.md)

# Wallet Connection

In our previous step we ensured that the wallet is connecting to our browser instance. Now let's connect to the extension.

## Begin Connection

What we are going to do now is add in some boilerplate code to get the wallet application to work with Ultra.

This code performs the following functions:

1. They click login and the ultra wallet prompts them to login.
2. After connecting, their `blockchainid` is stored.
3. Their `username` is then updated in the main window and shown to the user.
4. They may now click `logout` at any time to disconnect the wallet.

```html
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';

// Stores the username instance
let username = ref(undefined);

// Toggles to true when the login failed
let failedLogin = ref(false);

// Handles when the user clicks login
async function beginLogin() {
    try {
        const response = await ultra.connect();
        username.value = response.data.blockchainid;
    } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
        failedLogin.value = true;
    }
}

// Handles when the user clicks logout
async function logout() {
    try {
        await ultra.disconnect();
        username.value = undefined;
        failedLogin.value = false;
    } catch (err) {}
}
</script>

<template>
    <div>
        <h2 v-if="!failedLogin">{{ username ? username : 'Please Login...' }}</h2>
        <h2 v-else>Failed to Login...</h2>
        <br />
        <button v-if="!username" @click="beginLogin">Login</button>
        <button v-else @click="logout">Logout</button>
    </div>
</template>

<style scoped></style>

# Before Starting

Install the programs below, most if not all of them are required.

- Google Chrome, or Chromium Equivalent
- [Ultra Wallet Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ultra-wallet/kjjebdkfeagdoogagbhepmbimaphnfln)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [VS Code Editor, IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Setup

Open up a command line interface in the location where you want to start building a project. For this tutorial we are doing it on a separate drive in a folder called projects.

Run the following command, and type (y) to confirm.

```
npm create vite@latest
```

![](./images/vitepress-create-proceed.png)

![](./images/vitepress-create-after.png)

As you can see, I've created a project utilizing `Vue` with `JavaScript` as the main programming language.

The project title is `ultra-project`.

We now we need to run the commands `vite` printed out to the console.

```sh
cd ultra-project
npm install
npm run dev
```

If successful we should see a new empty project in our browser of choice.

![](./images/vitepress-server-started.png)

If we navigate to the URL printed in the terminal in our browser, you should see a page greeting us.

![](./images/vitepress-new-app.png)

Success! Let's move on to the next steps.

# Intro to Vite & Vue

This tutorial will help you understand how to setup your own web application to build a website that interfaces with smart contracts.

We'll be targetting Vue as our frontend framework of choice.

## What is Vite?

[Vite is a build tool](https://vitejs.dev/) that works with some of the most popular frameworks such as:

- Vue
- React
- Preact
- Lit
- Svelte
- Solid
- Qwik

Utilizing vite is a no brainer for modern frontend applications today.

## What is Ultra Wallet

Ultra wallet is a [**Google Chrome Extension**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ultra-wallet/kjjebdkfeagdoogagbhepmbimaphnfln) that allows a user to login to their Ultra account to sign transactions, messages, and more.

## Goal

You will get a working frontend application that utilizes the ultra wallet.

# Wallet Setup

Setting up the ultra wallet for your application is as simple as reading `window.ultra`. However, we have a few modifications we need to do to `Vite` so we can connect to the Ultra Extension in our browser.

## Open Your Project

In the previous steps we created a project called `ultra-project`.

We are now going to open that project in an IDE of our choice, we'll be using `VS Code` for this tutorial.

![](./images/vscode-init-project.png)

As you can see we have everything we need here.

- Project files on the left
- Terminal for running commands on the bottom
    - If this isn't opened just click Terminal in the menu at the top. Sometimes it's under the `...` menu.
- Editor where the larger `VS Code` logo is.

## Basic SSL Installation

We need to install an HTTPs server for Vite in order to properly preview and work with the ultra wallet. Let's do that right away.

Run the following command in terminal:

```
npm i -D @vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl
```

![](./images/install-basic-ssl.png)

This will add a new development package dependency.

### Edit `vite.config.js`

Modify your configuration to instantiate the `basicSSL` plugin inside of the `plugins` array.

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'
import BasicSSL from '@vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [vue(), BasicSSL()],
})
```

### Run `npm run dev`

Open your browser to the `URL` that is printed in your terminal, **while you are editing files the browser will automatically refresh**.

You should see your browser complaining about it not being private, this will not matter as we are developing locally.

::: warning
When you deploy your website to the world, you should secure it with HTTP(s) by utilizing a certificate provider.
:::

You can move past this by going to `advanced` and proceeding even though it is not safe.

![](./images/ignore-chrome-certificate.png)

## Edit `src/App.vue`

We are going to modify this main file and remove all the extras tags and data inside, and apply a simple boilerplate so we can see the changes directly.

**App.vue**
```tsx
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';

const greetingMessage = ref('My Ultra App');
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <h2>{{ greetingMessage }}</h2>
  </div>
</template>

<style scoped>
/** Leave this if you want to add some style later */
</style>

```

### Checking Wallet Instance

One of the first things we are going to do is check if the `ultra` variable is available inside of `window`.

What better way than to simply log `window.ultra` to console.

In **App.vue** `script` section add the following:

```tsx
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue';

const greetingMessage = ref('My Ultra App');

console.log(window.ultra);
</script>
```

Check your browser's console (F12) and see if an `object` prints out.

![](./images/ultra-wallet-present.png)

Looks good, let's move on to the next section.

# How to Integrate RNG in Smart Contracts

This guide shows you how to add secure, verifiable random number generation to your Ultra smart contract using the `ultra.rng` service.

## Quick Start

Want to add randomness to your contract? Here's what you need to do:

1. **Add the `receiverand` action** to your contract
2. **Call `requestrand`** when you need a random number
3. **Handle the callback** in your `receiverand` action

That's it! The Ultra oracle service handles the rest.

## How It Works

The Ultra RNG system is designed to be simple for developers:

```
Your Contract → ultra.rng → Oracle Service → Your Contract
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
  requestrand   queues job    generates &    receiverand
                & assigns     signs random   callback with
                job ID        number         random value
```

**Key Points:**
- Your contract requests a random number via `requestrand`
- The Ultra oracle service monitors and processes requests automatically
- Your contract receives the random number via the `receiverand` callback
- The system uses BLS12-381 cryptography to ensure the randomness cannot be manipulated

## Step 1: Add the Required Action to Your Contract

Your contract must implement a `receiverand` action that the RNG service will call:

```cpp
#include <eosio/eosio.hpp>

class [[eosio::contract("mycontract")]] mycontract : public eosio::contract {
public:
    mycontract(eosio::name receiver, eosio::name code, eosio::datastream<const char*> ds)
        : contract(receiver, code, ds) {}

    // This action will be called by the RNG service
    [[eosio::action]]
    void receiverand(uint64_t assoc_id, uint64_t random_value) {
        // Only the RNG contract can call this
        require_auth("ultra.rng"_n);
        
        // Handle your random number here
        handle_random_result(assoc_id, random_value);
    }

private:
    void handle_random_result(uint64_t assoc_id, uint64_t random_value) {
        // Your logic here - example: roll a dice
        uint64_t dice_roll = (random_value % 6) + 1;
        
        // Store result, update state, etc.
        // ...
    }
};
```

## Step 2: Request a Random Number

When you need randomness in your contract, call the RNG service:

```cpp
[[eosio::action]]
void start_game(eosio::name player) {
    require_auth(player);
    
    // Generate a unique request ID
    uint64_t request_id = get_next_request_id();
    
    // Generate a unique seed (important for security)
    uint64_t seed = current_time_point().sec_since_epoch() + player.value + request_id;
    
    // Store the pending request
    pending_requests.emplace(get_self(), [&](auto& req) {
        req.id = request_id;
        req.player = player;
        req.timestamp = current_time_point();
    });
    
    // Request the random number
    eosio::action(
        eosio::permission_level{get_self(), "active"_n},
        "ultra.rng"_n,
        "requestrand"_n,
        std::make_tuple(request_id, seed, get_self())
    ).send();
}
```

## Step 3: Handle the Random Number

The RNG service will call your `receiverand` action with the random number:

```cpp
[[eosio::action]]
void receiverand(uint64_t assoc_id, uint64_t random_value) {
    require_auth("ultra.rng"_n);
    
    // Find your pending request
    auto req_it = pending_requests.find(assoc_id);
    check(req_it != pending_requests.end(), "Request not found");
    
    // Use the random number for your logic
    uint64_t game_result = random_value % 100; // 0-99
    
    // Update your contract state
    game_results.emplace(get_self(), [&](auto& result) {
        result.id = game_results.available_primary_key();
        result.player = req_it->player;
        result.value = game_result;
        result.timestamp = current_time_point();
    });
    
    // Clean up the pending request
    pending_requests.erase(req_it);
}
```

## Complete Integration Example

Here's a complete example showing how to integrate RNG into a simple game contract:

```cpp
#include <eosio/eosio.hpp>
#include <eosio/time.hpp>

class [[eosio::contract("rnggame")]] rnggame : public eosio::contract {
public:
    rnggame(eosio::name receiver, eosio::name code, eosio::datastream<const char*> ds)
        : contract(receiver, code, ds) {}

    // User action to start a random game
    [[eosio::action]]
    void play_game(eosio::name player) {
        require_auth(player);
        
        // Check if player can play
        check(get_player_balance(player) >= 100, "Insufficient balance");
        
        // Deduct fee
        update_balance(player, -100);
        
        // Generate unique request ID
        uint64_t request_id = get_next_request_id();
        uint64_t seed = current_time_point().sec_since_epoch() + player.value + request_id;
        
        // Store pending game
        pending_games.emplace(get_self(), [&](auto& game) {
            game.request_id = request_id;
            game.player = player;
            game.timestamp = current_time_point();
        });
        
        // Request random number
        eosio::action(
            eosio::permission_level{get_self(), "active"_n},
            "ultra.rng"_n,
            "requestrand"_n,
            std::make_tuple(request_id, seed, get_self())
        ).send();
    }

    // RNG callback - called by ultra.rng contract
    [[eosio::action]]
    void receiverand(uint64_t assoc_id, uint64_t random_value) {
        require_auth("ultra.rng"_n);
        
        auto game_it = pending_games.find(assoc_id);
        check(game_it != pending_games.end(), "Game request not found");
        
        // Determine game outcome (example: win if random_value > 50)
        bool is_winner = random_value > 50;
        uint64_t payout = is_winner ? 200 : 0; // Win: 2x, Lose: 0
        
        // Update player balance
        update_balance(game_it->player, payout);
        
        // Record game result
        game_history.emplace(get_self(), [&](auto& result) {
            result.id = game_history.available_primary_key();
            result.player = game_it->player;
            result.random_value = random_value;
            result.is_winner = is_winner;
            result.payout = payout;
            result.timestamp = current_time_point();
        });
        
        // Clean up
        pending_games.erase(game_it);
    }

    };
    
    struct [[eosio::table]] game_result {

    };
    
    struct [[eosio::table]] player_balance {
        eosio::name player;
        uint64_t balance;
        
        uint64_t primary_key() const { return player.value; }

        return current_time_point().sec_since_epoch();
    }
    
    uint64_t get_player_balance(eosio::name player) {
        auto balance_it = player_balances.find(player.value);
        return balance_it != player_balances.end() ? balance_it->balance : 0;
    }
    
    void update_balance(eosio::name player, int64_t delta) {
        auto balance_it = player_balances.find(player.value);
        if (balance_it == player_balances.end()) {
            player_balances.emplace(get_self(), [&](auto& balance) {
                balance.player = player;
                balance.balance = delta > 0 ? delta : 0;
            });
        } else {
            player_balances.modify(balance_it, get_self(), [&](auto& balance) {
                balance.balance = std::max(0ULL, (uint64_t)((int64_t)balance.balance + delta));
            });
        }
    }
};
```

## Testing Your Integration

### 1. Deploy Your Contract

```bash
# Compile and deploy
eosio-cpp -o rnggame.wasm rnggame.cpp
cleos set contract rnggame /path/to/contract -p rnggame@active
```

### 2. Test the Integration

```bash
# Start a game
cleos push action rnggame play_game '["player1"]' -p player1@active

# Check pending games
cleos get table rnggame rnggame pendinggames

# Wait for oracle processing, then check results
cleos get table rnggame rnggame gamehistory
```

### 3. Monitor the Process

```bash
# Check if your request was queued
cleos get table ultra.rng ultra.rng jobs

# Monitor for the callback
cleos get actions rnggame
```

## Important Implementation Details

### Unique Seeds
Always use unique seeds to prevent replay attacks:
```cpp
uint64_t seed = current_time_point().sec_since_epoch() + player.value + request_id;
```

### Request Tracking
Store pending requests to handle the callback:
```cpp
pending_requests.emplace(get_self(), [&](auto& req) {
    req.id = request_id;
    req.player = player;
    req.timestamp = current_time_point();
});
```

### Security
Only allow the RNG contract to call your callback:
```cpp
require_auth("ultra.rng"_n);
```

### Error Handling
Always check if the request exists:
```cpp
auto req_it = pending_requests.find(assoc_id);
check(req_it != pending_requests.end(), "Request not found");
```

## Common Patterns

### Random Selection
```cpp
uint64_t selection = random_value % total_options;
```

### Weighted Random
```cpp
uint64_t weighted_result = random_value % 100;
if (weighted_result < 30) {
    // 30% chance
} else if (weighted_result < 60) {
    // 30% chance
} else {
    // 40% chance
}
```

### Range Generation
```cpp
uint64_t min = 1;
uint64_t max = 100;
uint64_t result = min + (random_value % (max - min + 1));
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always use unique seeds** - Combine timestamp, user ID, and request ID
2. **Store pending requests** - Track requests to handle callbacks properly
3. **Validate callbacks** - Check that the RNG contract is calling your action
4. **Handle errors gracefully** - Implement proper error handling for missing requests
5. **Test thoroughly** - Test your integration before deploying to mainnet
6. **Monitor performance** - The oracle service may take time to process requests

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `Request not found` | Ensure you're storing pending requests properly |
| `Authentication errors` | Check that your contract has the correct permissions |
| `Seed already used` | Use unique seeds for each request |
| `No response received` | Check that your request was queued in the RNG jobs table |
| `Banned account` | Contact Ultra support if your contract is banned |

## Use Cases

- **Gaming**: Dice rolls, card games, loot boxes
- **NFTs**: Random trait generation, rarity distribution
- **Lotteries**: Fair random selection
- **Airdrops**: Random recipient selection
- **Gambling**: Provably fair games

## Next Steps

- [RNG Contract Reference](/blockchain/contracts/rng-contract/) - Detailed contract documentation
- [requestrand - Request random numbers](/blockchain/contracts/rng-contract/rng-actions/requestrand) - Main action for requesting RNG
- [RNG Contract Tables](/blockchain/contracts/rng-contract/rng-tables) - Table structures

The Ultra RNG service provides enterprise-grade random number generation for your smart contracts. The integration is simple, secure, and ready for production use.

The goal of this tutorial is to compile smart contracts using the Ultra Smart Contract VS Code Extension.

## How to Compile

There are **two ways** to compile your smart contract.

First way is to compile using the VS Code Status Bar. Make sure you have the `.cpp` file open and selected and click `Compile` at the bottom of VS Code.

![](./images/compile-button.png)

Second way to compile is to use the `Command Palette (F1)` and search for `Ultra: Build Contract`.

![](./images/command-palette-build.png)

## Successful Compilation

If the compilation is successful, you won't see any `errors` in the output window for `ultra-cpp`.

![](./images/successful-build.png)

## Bad Compilation

If the compilation is successful unsuccessful, you will see various errors such as the ones below.

![](./images/unsuccessful-build.png)

## Compiled Files

Once the files are compiled you should see an `abi` and a `wasm` file next to your compiled smart contract.

![](./images/compiled-files.png)

For more information about `.abi` and `.wasm` files see the [official EOS Network Foundation page](https://docs.eosnetwork.com/docs/latest/quick-start/build-and-deploy#what-does-a-smart-contract-build-to)

## What's next?

The next tutorial will cover deploying smart contracts using the VS Code extension. See [Tutorial - Deploy Smart Contracts using the Ultra Smart Contract VS Code Extension](./deploy.md) for more information.

# Tutorial - Deploy Smart Contracts using the Ultra Smart Contract VS Code Extension

Once you have an `abi` and `wasm` file for your contract, you are ready for deployment.

## Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to guide you through deploying a smart contract using the Ultra Smart Contract VS Code Extension.

## Prerequisites

-   A compiled smart contract (`.wasm` and `.abi` files). Refer to the [Tutorial - Compile Smart Contracts using the Ultra Smart Contract VS Code Extension](./compile.md) for more information.
-   A public-private key pair for your developer Testnet account. If you haven't generated a key pair yet, refer to [Tutorial - Generate a key and create a developer Testnet account](../fundamentals/tutorial-generate-key-and-create-testnet-account.md)
-   Your account must have sufficient UOS tokens for transactions and fees. Refer to [Tutorial - Using the Faucet and Buying RAM on Ultra Testnet](../fundamentals/tutorial-obtain-token-and-purchase-ram.md#obtaining-uos-tokens-using-the-faucet) for more information.

::: info
The tutorial is up-to-date with version 1.4.2 of the VS Code extension
:::

## Add Developer Testnet Account

Before you can deploy a smart contract, you will need to add your developer Testnet account to the Ultra Smart Contract VS Code Extension. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Using the Command Palette (F1), type and select `Ultra: Wallet - Create`.
   ![](./images/command-palette-create-wallet.png)
2. Enter a password for your wallet and re-enter the password to confirm it. Please make a note of this as it will be needed later to unlock the wallet.
   ![](./images/command-palette-create-wallet-set-pwd.png)
3. Enter the private key for your developer Testnet account.
   ![](./images/command-palette-create-wallet-set-pk.png)
4. You will see a prompt on the bottom right that says `Added Public Key`.
   ![](./images/vscode-ext-added-public-key.png)

You have now added your developer testnet account to the Ultra Smart Contract VS Code Extension.

## Deploy Contract

1. Using the Command Palette (F1), type and select `Ultra: Deploy Contract`.
   ![](./images/command-palette-deploy.png)

2. Select the contract you want to deploy.
   ![](./images/command-palette-deploy-select-contract.png)

3. Select the `Ultra Testnet` endpoint.
   ![](./images/command-palette-deploy-select-endpoint.png)

4. Unlock your wallet by entering your wallet password.
   ![](./images/command-palette-deploy-unlock-wallet.png)

5. Enter the account you want to deploy this contract to. For the sake of this contract, you should deploy to your own developer Testnet account.
   ![](./images/command-palette-deploy-account-name.png)

6. If successful you will see the smart contract has been deployed in the output window.
   ![](./images/vscode-ext-contract-deployment-output.png)

## Redeploy Smart Contract

After you've made some changes to your contract, you will need to build it again and redeploy.

Redeploying the contract is identical to the first time you've deployed the contract. Just follow the above instructions and use the same account to deploy to.

## Troubleshooting Deployment Errors

If you run into any issues during the deployment, refer to [Troubleshooting Deployment](./troubleshooting.md) for more information.

## What's next?

The next tutorial will cover interacting with your deployed smart contracts using the VS Code extension. See [Tutorial - Interact with Smart Contracts using the Ultra Smart Contract VS Code Extension](./transact.md) for more information.

When you want to create a data entry, store it, update it, and delete that entry from a table owned by a user.

This means that table entries are owned by the user for their specific table. Only they can modify their entries.

The code below is the equivalent of a Twitter clone.

::: details Code

<<< @/examples/contracts/contract-with-table-scope.cpp

:::

## Reading Data from Table Iterators

In some cases, you may need to read directly from a table in a contract.

You can use the iterator to directly access the data.

The code below is based on the Scoped CRUD Operations

::: details Code

```cpp
journal_t scoped_journal = journal_t(get_self(), user.value);
auto journal_itr = scoped_journal.require_find(timepoint, "entry was not found");
print("Message at ", timepoint, " is ", journal_itr->message);
```

:::

## Listening for Token Transfers

The code below allows only the default `UOS` token with a precision of `8`.

_You must add the `eosio.code` permission to your account to use this._

::: details Code

<<< @/examples/contracts/contract-on-notify-eosio-token.cpp

## Listening for Uniq Transfers

If you want to listen for transfers from `eosio.nft.ft` see [onIssue Example](../../tutorials/uniq-factories/uniq-variants/Examples/on-issue.md).

# Tutorial - Install and Setup the Ultra Smart Contract VS Code Extension

## Prerequisites

-   Have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed before using the extension.
-   [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    -   [Microsoft C++ Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) (optional, but recommended)

::: info
The tutorial is up-to-date with version 1.4.2 of the VS Code Extension
:::

## Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to install the Ultra Smart Contract VS Code Extension and getting started with writing smart contracts.

## Installation

You can download the extension from [VS Code Market Place](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ultraio.ultra-cpp), or you can manually install it via VS Code.

To install the extension via VS Code, follow these steps:

1. Open up your VS Code and click on the `Extensions` tab, or press `Ctrl + Shift + X`
2. Under the `Extensions` tab, search for `ultra-cpp`
3. Click on the `Install` button

![](./images/install-vscode-ext.png)

You have now successfully installed the Ultra Smart Contract VS Code Extension. To verify the installation, make sure you have `ᕫ API` item in the VS Code status bar.

![](./images/vscode-ext-installed.png)

## Scaffolding

Depending on where you want to start your project. Always start with a workspace folder and open it in VS Code.

![](./images/select-project-folder.png)

Once you have the Ultra Smart Contract VS Code Extension installed, you can easily create a starting template.

Access the `Command Palette` in VS Code with `F1` on the keyboard.

![](./images/open-command-palette.png)

### Command Palette Command

```
Ultra: Create Smart Contract
```

It will prompt you for a folder to put the source code under. It is recommended to use `src` if it's a single contract.

## Header Setup

After creating the contract, you will need to **install headers** to remove some of the errors you will get from VS Code about the code.

There are currently **two ways** to install headers.

-   First way is to open your `.cpp` file that was generated, and follow the prompts
-   The second way is to open the the `Command Palette (F1)` and search for `Ultra: Add C++ Header Files for EOSIO`

Make sure you agree to both prompts (`Add Ultra.io Header Files` and `Add C++ Support`):

![](./images/vscode-ultra-headers.png)

![](./images/vscode-ultra-cpp-support.png)

After installation, and following the prompts, the VS Code window will restart itself.

Wait for intellisense to finish updating to ensure everything is working correctly.

![](./images/intellisense-updating.png)

![](./images/intellisense-ready.png)

Any other prompts from VS Code can be ignored (including prompts related to Docker or CMake Tools if you have those installed)

## What's next?

The next tutorial will cover compiling smart contracts using the VS Code extension. See [Tutorial - Compile Smart Contracts using the Ultra Smart Contract VS Code Extension](./compile.md) for more information.

# Tutorial - Interact with Smart Contracts using the Ultra Smart Contract VS Code Extension

Once you have deployed your contract, you are ready for interacting with your contract.

## Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to interact with deployed smart contracts using the Ultra Smart Contract VS Code Extension.

## Prerequisites

-   You must have deployed your smart contract. Refer to [Tutorial - Deploy Smart Contracts using the Ultra Smart Contract VS Code Extension](./deploy.md).

::: info
The tutorial is up-to-date with version 1.4.2 of the VS Code extension
:::

## Interacting with Smart Contract

To interact with your deployed smart contract, follow these steps:

1. Use the Command Palette (F1), type `Ultra: Create Transaction`.
   ![](./images/command-palette-create-tx.png)

2. Select the endpoint where your smart contract is deployed.
   ![](./images/command-palette-deploy-select-endpoint.png)

3. Enter the password for the local wallet that you created in the previous tutorial.
   ![](./images/command-palette-create-tx-password.png)

4. Enter the name of the account which the contract was deployed under.
   ![](./images/command-palette-create-tx-account-name.png)

5. You will now see a list of available actions for your smart contract. Select the one that you want to interact with.
   ![](./images/command-palette-create-tx-select-action.png)

6. Enter the signer account. The signer should be the account you have access to. For the sake of this tutorial, we will use the same account where we deployed the smart contract.
   ![](./images/command-palette-create-tx-signing-acc.png)

7. You will now see a transaction form. Fill out your transaction data, and execute it by clicking on the `Sign & Send` button.
   ![](./images/vscode-ext-contract-action-interaction.png)

8. If successful, you will see the transaction response in the output window.
   ![](./images/vscode-ext-contract-action-interaction-output.png)

You can use the transaction id and search for the transaction on the [Ultra Testnet Block Explorer](https://explorer.testnet.ultra.io/).

# Troubleshooting Deployment

## Invalid UOS precision

```sh
Error 3050003: eosio_assert_message assertion failure
Error Details:
assertion failure with message: must buy ram with core token
```

Make sure UOS is specified with **exactly** 8 decimals as in [buyram](../../blockchain/contracts/system-contract/system-actions/buyram.html#buyram-buy-ram-with-uos) page.

## Docker container start issues

You may get a port allocated

```
1f9fd2ba03b243b5c8dabff76b9ffa49a8141af0fc9f7d46b37f9054e8cc945f
docker: Error response from daemon: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint ultra (2da26f7837141bd89470ce839b24c5ce9784376c7bdf8ffdcbaa6e93495773cf): Bind for 0.0.0.0:9876 failed: port is already allocated.
```

Consider stoppping a process listening to that port or reassigning a mapping to a different port on your host machine, i.e `-p 9876:1234`

You can also change your workdir (output directory) with `-v`. Refer to docker [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/#choose-the--v-or---mount-flag).

## VS Code Extension docker unavailable

![](/images/vscode-docker-issue.png)

If you get `docker unavailable` error message make sure you have disconnected from docker container by clicking on the bottom-left corner.

# Connecting to Pinax Substreams endpoints

Pinax provides firehose/SubStreams endpoints for several blockchains, including EOS based ones.  
To connect to thier endpoints, you can have an account on Pinax App Platform and get an API key.  
See [Introducing the New Pinax App, a Better Way to Manage Your Firehose and Substreams Services - The Official Pinax Blog](https://blog.pinax.network/pinax/introducing-the-new-pinax-app-a-better-way-to-manage-your-firehose-and-substreams-services/) for the details.  

## Create an account on Pinax App Platform and create a project

1. Visit https://app.pinax.network. The first time you visit the site, you will be directed to `Authorize Pinax` page to create an account using GitHub login.  
2. Create a new project, where you will get your API key and JWT.  
3. Enter the project and select `Substreams` tab, and push `View configurations` button.   
4. Select `ENDPOINT URL`. For the purpose of this tutorial, select the endpoint for EOS mainnet, ` https://eos.substreams.pinax.network:443`  

## Running Substreams CLI

1. Select `cURL` tab.
2. You may install [the Substreams CLI](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/getting-started/installing-the-cli) to continue.  
3. Follow the below instructions and execute somme commands in the terminal.  
```sh
# Set your API Key
export SUBSTREAMS_API_KEY=(your API key)
# Run Substreams CLI
substreams run -e eos.substreams.pinax.network:443 https://github.com/pinax-network/substreams/releases/download/blocks-v0.1.0/blocks-v0.1.0.spkg map_blocks -s -10
```

## Running a JavaScript example

You can see the sample code, `substreams.js`, in `JavaScript` tab.  
To run `substreams.js`:
1. Create a folder and store `.env` and `substreams.js` in it.
2. Prepare `package.json` and execute `npm install`.

Below is a working example of files.  
- `.env`  
```

# Substreams Quickstart

The goal of this document is to get a development environment set up in as little time as possible.

Here is a quick introduction to [Substreams from StreamingFast](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/).

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, please make sure you have all these tools installed.

- `helm` is the tool for downloading a chart and installing it to your target cluster.
- `minikube` is the tool for setting up a cluster in your local machine. This cluster will have all the basic functions of any other cloud solution.
- `kubectl` is the tool for managing all the deployments/pods/services from your cluster which includes some useful functions like monitoring, deploying, debugging, etc.

### Installing `helm`

-   [Helm for Windows](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/#from-chocolatey-windows).
-   Helm for Linux.
    - [Install from Scripts](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/#from-script).
    - [Install from Apt](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/#from-apt-debianubuntu).
    - [Install from Source](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/#from-source-linux-macos).
-   [Helm for Mac](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/#from-homebrew-macos).

Make sure `helm` is installed properly:

```sh
helm version
```
```sh
version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.14.4", GitCommit:"81c902a123462fd4052bc5e9aa9c513c4c8fc142", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.21.9"}
```

### Installing `minikube`

Make sure you already install `docker`, if not you can follow our [Docker Quick-start](../docker/getting-started.md).

-   [Minikube for Windows/Linux/Mac](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).

Make sure `minikube` can start properly:

```sh
minikube version
```
```sh
minikube version: v1.32.0
commit: 8220a6eb95f0a4d75f7f2d7b14cef975f050512d
```

### Installing `kubectl`

-   [Kubectl for Windows](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows).
-   [Kubectl for Linux](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux).
-   [Kubectl for Mac](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-macos).

Alternatively, you can use `minikube` to download the appropriate version of `kubectl`. You can start the download process with this command.

```sh
minikube kubectl -- version
```

## Starting / Stopping `minikube`

For starting, make sure you have docker running. The result might be different the first time you run it.

```sh
minikube start
```
```sh
😄  minikube v1.32.0 on Ubuntu 22.04 (amd64)
✨  Using the docker driver based on existing profile
👍  Starting control plane node minikube in cluster minikube
🚜  Pulling base image ...
🔄  Restarting existing docker container for "minikube" ...
🐳  Preparing Kubernetes v1.28.3 on Docker 24.0.7 ...
🔗  Configuring bridge CNI (Container Networking Interface) ...
🔎  Verifying Kubernetes components...
    ▪ Using image gcr.io/k8s-minikube/storage-provisioner:v5
🌟  Enabled addons: storage-provisioner, default-storageclass
🏄  Done! kubectl is now configured to use "minikube" cluster and "default" namespace by default
```

To test if the local cluster is working properly.

```sh
kubectl get po -A
```
```sh
NAMESPACE     NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
kube-system   coredns-5dd5756b68-jrqxj           1/1     Running   1 (21m ago)   23m
kube-system   etcd-minikube                      1/1     Running   2 (21m ago)   24m
kube-system   kube-apiserver-minikube            1/1     Running   2 (21m ago)   24m
kube-system   kube-controller-manager-minikube   1/1     Running   2 (21m ago)   24m
kube-system   kube-proxy-hsbj4                   1/1     Running   1 (21m ago)   24m
kube-system   kube-scheduler-minikube            1/1     Running   2 (21m ago)   24m
kube-system   storage-provisioner                1/1     Running   3 (19s ago)   24m
```

For stopping.

```sh
minikube stop
```
```sh
✋  Stopping node "minikube"  ...
🛑  Powering off "minikube" via SSH ...
🛑  1 node stopped.
```

Or if you want to clear any persistent data please use
```sh
minikube delete
```
```sh
🔥  Deleting "minikube" in docker ...
🔥  Deleting container "minikube" ...
🔥  Removing /home/duncan/.minikube/machines/minikube ...
💀  Removed all traces of the "minikube" cluster.
```

## Deploy `substreams-charts`

`substreams-charts` contains helm templates for deploying all core applications of `Substreams`.

### Pull `substreams-charts` release

**NOTE**: If you clone our [substreams-charts Repo](https://github.com/ultraio/substreams-charts) directly, please skip ahead.

You can check out our [substreams-charts Release](https://github.com/ultraio/substreams-charts/releases). Find the release you want to download.

Please note version mentioned next might be out of date by the time you read this, please use the latest version for the most compatible.

Next, you can use this command to pull the charts to your local directory.

```sh
helm pull https://github.com/ultraio/substreams-charts/releases/download/firehose-antelope-1.0.3/firehose-antelope-1.0.3.tgz --untar
```

`firehose-antelope-1.0.3.tgz` will be downloaded and unpacked in your current folder under the name `./firehose-antelope`

Additionally, for running a producer node on the same cluster, please pull out another chart called `producer`.

```sh
helm pull https://github.com/ultraio/substreams-charts/releases/download/producer-0.1.0/producer-0.1.0.tgz --untar
```

`producer-0.1.0.tgz` will be downloaded and unpacked in your current folder under the name `./producer`

### Deploy `producer` chart

Start your `minikube`

```sh
minikube start
```

Once `minikube` is up, you need to deploy `producer` chart, which will contain a `producer` pod that will run `ultratest` out of the box.

```sh
helm install producer ./producer
```

Check your deployment

```sh
kubectl get pod producer-0
```

Make sure the status is `Running`. You can also use `kubectl get pod producer-0 --watch` to watch the update.

```sh
NAME         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
producer-0   1/1     Running   0          57s
```

**NOTE**: If you follow the above instructions, your `producer-0` can be reached at `producer-0.producer.default.svc.cluster.local`. This is important because we will use this IP in `substreams` reader node to connect to the producer to feed block data from it. If for some reason you decide to deploy it in another namespace or under another name, please use this to find its cluster IP `kubectl get pod -o wide`, or you can follow the instructions below.

Deploy `dnsutils` pod to your cluster
```sh
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/admin/dns/dnsutils.yaml
```

Check the `NAME` and `IP` of your producer pod
```sh
kubectl get pod -o wide
```
```sh
NAME         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP           NODE       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
producer-0   1/1     Running   0          4m43s   10.244.0.3   minikube   <none>           <none>
```

Check the `NAME` of your producer service
```sh
kubectl get service
```
```sh
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
producer     ClusterIP   None         <none>        8888/TCP,9876/TCP   16m
```

You can use the `pod_name.service_name` to find the Pod's DNS name.
```sh
kubectl exec -i -t dnsutils -- nslookup producer-0.producer
```

Or you can use the Pod's `IP`
```sh
kubectl exec -i -t dnsutils -- nslookup 10.244.0.3
```

Both methods will have the same result
```sh
Server:         10.96.0.10
Address:        10.96.0.10#53

Name:   producer-0.producer.default.svc.cluster.local
Address: 10.244.0.3
```

### Deploy `firehose-antelope` chart

Before deploying the `firehose-antelope` chart, make sure to create `values.yaml` file to configure your deployment. You can use the file below for your local test:

    substreamsStateStoreUrl: "file:///storage/state-store"
  # enabled local storage to replace gloud storage
  localVolume:
    enabled: true
firehose:
  replicaCount: 1
  statefulset:
    commonOneBlockStoreUrl: "file:///storage/one-blocks"
    commonMergedBlocksStoreUrl: "file:///storage/merged-blocks"
    commonForkedBlocksStoreUrl: "file:///storage/forked-blocks"
  # enabled local storage to replace gloud storage
  localVolume:
    enabled: true

```

Some important configurations you need to know:

- `statefulset: persistentVolumeClaimEnabled = false`: This will disable the persistent volume claim which is only used in Ultra's deployment.
- `localVolume: enabled = true`: This will enable local storage to replace cloud storage, this will make use of `minikube` persist file store. You can read more here [Persistent Volumes](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/persistent_volumes/).
- `p2p-peer-address = producer-0.producer.default.svc.cluster.local:9876`: you can see why I mentioned the importance of this config above. If you use a different name/namespace please update the according to the format mentioned in [DNS Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/#pods) or simply use get pod IP and replace it here.

The final step is to install `firehose-antelope` chart

```sh
helm install firehose-antelope ./firehose-antelope -f ./values.yaml
```
If the deployment has no error, you should see `READY` at `1/1` (please ignore `firehose` ready status for now).
```sh
kubectl get pod
```
```sh
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
firehose-0                 0/1     Running   0          2m27s
merger-0                   1/1     Running   0          2m27s

substreams-tier2-0         1/1     Running   0          2m27s
```
### Deploy `substreams-charts` to Google Kubernetes Engines (GKE) cluster

**NOTE**: If you are familiar with deployment with `GKE`, once you log in and connect to your project, you can use the same `helm` commands to deploy to `GKE`.

If not familiar with GKE, you can follow these tutorials:

- Installing [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)
- Create a cluster and [deploy an app to GKE cluster](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/deploy-app-cluster)

Once you can deploy an app on your own GKE cluster, you can use the same `helm` commands provided above to deploy `substreams-charts`.

### Switching between `minikube` and `GKE`

If you are using both `minikube` and `GKE` with `kubectl`, to switch between them, you can follow the steps below.

```sh
kubectl config get-contexts
```
```sh
CURRENT   NAME       CLUSTER    AUTHINFO   NAMESPACE
          gke_***    gke_***    gke_***    GKE_NAMESPACE
*         minikube   minikube   minikube   default
```

Now select the context `NAME` you want to switch to.

```sh
kubectl config use-context gke_***
```
You should see `CURRENT` switch to your desired context.
```sh
kubectl config get-contexts
```
```sh
CURRENT   NAME       CLUSTER    AUTHINFO   NAMESPACE
*         gke_***    gke_***    gke_***    GKE_NAMESPACE
          minikube   minikube   minikube   default
```

## How to consume `Substreams` data

Now you have `Substreams` components deployed on clusters and connected to a `nodeos` producer.

To make use of it, please refer to [Substreams Application Example](./substreams-app-example.md)

# Substreams Sink Application Example

Any application that is being used to consume `Substreams data` will be referred to as `Substreams Sink`.

If you follow the deployment of `substreams charts` from [Getting Started](./getting-started.md), you should now have a working `Substreams` cluster locally.

However, this local cluster will only help you to extract block data from `producer` pod or a blockchain if you connect to a public endpoint instead.

To fully make use of these block data you will need something called `Substreams Packages` which will be used like a filter to extract exactly the data you need. For example:
- Get transaction data from a block
- Find action data based on action name and account
- Find transaction by hash
- etc.

A `Substreams Package` is a ready-to-consume binary file, which contains all the necessary dependencies (manifest, modules, protobufs...). You can read more about [Substreams Packages](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/documentation/consume/packages) and how to develop your own [Manifest and Modules](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/documentation/develop/manifest-modules) to create a new `Substreams package`. Alternatively, you can go to [Pinax Substreams package](https://github.com/pinax-network/substreams) for `Ultra` compatible `Substreams` package.

Finally, with these filtered data, you can use it by storing it in a database, displaying it in an explorer, etc.

## Prerequisites

Here is an example that demonstrates how you can make use of `Substreams` package and extract `eosio.token` `transfer` action from `Substreams` cluster.

The example will be a `Node.js` application written in `Typescript` with `yarn` as package manager, so make sure you have these installed before starting.
- [Install Node.js for Windows/macOS with Installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Install Node.js for Windows/macOS/Linux with Package Manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
- Install `yarn` (you can skip if you prefer `npm`)
```sh
npm install --global yarn
```

This application will make use of 2 packages:
- [substreams-js](https://github.com/substreams-js/substreams-js)
- [substreams-node](https://github.com/substreams-js/substreams-node)

## Setup project

Setting up a `Typescript` project

Create a new directory and navigate to it

Initialize project
```sh
yarn init -y
```

Install `Typescript`
```sh
yarn add -D typescript
```

Initialize `Typescript`
```sh
npx tsc --init
```

A new `tsconfig.json` will be created. For the sake of the tutorial, please use your text editor and update the project as below.
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2020",
    "module": "esnext",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "strict": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "baseUrl": "src",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
  }
}
```

Add these configurations to `package.json`
```json
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "tsc && node dist/index.js"
  }
```

Install `substreams` dependency
```sh
yarn add @substreams/node
```

## Adding example script
Make a new directory name `src` and add a new file called `index.ts`.

```Typescript
import { createGrpcTransport } from "@connectrpc/connect-node";
import {
  createRegistry,
  createRequest,
  fetchSubstream,
  isEmptyMessage,
  streamBlocks,
  unpackMapOutput,
} from "@substreams/core";

const PACKAGE = "https://github.com/pinax-network/substreams/releases/download/eosio.token-v0.13.2/eosio-token-v0.13.2.spkg";
const OUTPUT_MODULE = "map_transfers";

const manifest = await fetchSubstream(PACKAGE);
const registry = createRegistry(manifest);
const transport = createGrpcTransport({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:9000",
  httpVersion: "1.1",
  interceptors: [],
  jsonOptions: {
    typeRegistry: registry,
  },
});

const request = createRequest({
  substreamPackage: manifest,
  outputModule: OUTPUT_MODULE,
  productionMode: true,
  startBlockNum: 0,
  stopBlockNum: "+100",
});

for await (const response of streamBlocks(transport, request)) {
  const output = unpackMapOutput(response, registry);
  if (output !== undefined && !isEmptyMessage(output)) {
    console.dir(output.toJson({ typeRegistry: registry }));
  }
}
```

Some important configurations:
- `PACKAGE` - This is the released package from [Pinax Nework Substreams Package Release](https://github.com/pinax-network/substreams/releases). We used `eosio.token` package since it's compatible with Ultra's chain.
- `OUTPUT_MODULE` - This is a data filter name. In this example, we will use `map_transfers` which is a filter for any transaction that contains `transfer` action from `eosio.token` contract.
- `baseURL` - this is the service endpoint of `substreams-tier1` component. The request will be sent to this component and the result will be sent back.
- `startBlockNum` - The block number where the search will start.
- `stopBlockNum` - The block number where the search will end. If you use `+100`, it will stop after 100 blocks.

This script will search all transactions from the start block to the end block, then it will output any transaction that contains `tranfer` action from `eosio.token` contract.

## Run the app

Make sure you follow the [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) and start a local cluster.

Once all the pods are ready, you need to forward the `substreams-tier1` service port for testing.
```sh
kubectl port-forward service/substreams-tier1 9000:9000
```
```
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:9000 -> 9000
Forwarding from [::1]:9000 -> 9000
```

**Note**: Make sure to keep this console tab open to maintain the connection.


Finally, you run the application with
```sh
yarn start
```

With the default configurations, you should see this result in your console.
```sh

# Token Overview

A fungible token is a token system that is built in Ultra.

Below are the features that were developed for our token contract.

-   [Token Burn - Allow token to be burnt on transfer](./token-burn.md)
-   [Token Tax - Allow token to be taxed on transfer](./token-tax.md)
-   [Token Metadata - Allow adding metadata for token](./token-metadata.md)

---
title: 'Token Burn'

outline: [0,4]
order: 2

# Token Burn Overview

## Overview

Token burn will allow the token creator to apply burn policy on any transfer made with specific token.

When token supply reach certain level, any transfer will be burnt with specific percentage, which is set by token creator.

Sender can be added to whitelist and will be exempted from any burn.

The burnt token amount will be deducted directly from recipient and transfer to configured receiver.

Also burn amount will be deducted directly to token current supply.

Actual burnt amount will be capped to make sure token supply will never go below the trigger threshold.

Only token creator and Ultra can set burn config for creator's token.

Once burn config is set for token, you cannot switch to other strategy.

Usage of the actions for config token burn

-   [configburn - Add or update burn config for token](../../blockchain/contracts/token-contract/token-actions/configburn.md)

## Benefits

- Allow token creator have more flexible policy with their token
---
title: 'Token Metadata'

outline: [0,4]
order: 1
---

# Token Metadata Overview

## Overview

Token creator can add metadata for their existing fungitable token, and metadata will include `name`, `icon` URL, `desciption` and `color`.

Here some limit for metadata:

- `name` must be more than 2 characters and less than 24 characters, and can only contain alphabet, number, `.` or `_`.

- `icon` URL and `desciption` cannot have more than 128 characters.

Usage of the actions for update token metadata

-   [updatemeta - Add or update token metadata](../../blockchain/contracts/token-contract/token-actions/updatemeta.md)

## Benefits

- Allow token creator config their own token metadata then later use this for displaying their token if needed.

# Token Tax Overview

## Overview

Token tax will allow the token creator to apply tax policy on any transfer made with specific token.

When token supply reach certain level, any transfer will be taxed with specific percentage, which is set by token creator.

Sender can be added to whitelist and will be exempted from any tax.

The tax amount will be deducted directly from recipient and transfer to configured receiver.

Only token creator and Ultra can set tax config for creator's token.

Once tax config is set for token, you cannot switch to other strategy.

Usage of the actions for config token tax

# How to create multiple Uniq Factories using the Ultra Tool Kit

![](/images/token-factories/new-token-factory.png)

## Prerequisites

- A basic understanding
  of [Factory Metadata](../uniq-variants/factory-metadata.md), [Default Uniq Metadata](../uniq-variants/uniq-default-metadata.md)
  and [Uniq Metadata](../uniq-variants/uniq-metadata.md).
- Ultra Tool Kit Account: Ensure you are logged in and have access to the Ultra Toolkit.
- You will need a Google account to make a copy of the [Bulk Factory Creation - Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17xvyrAUYB-3Hugu0UY2A4SnA2RbXLVuNv3K_gyca6xY/edit?usp=sharing).
- CSV File: Prepare a CSV file containing all the necessary data for creating Uniq Factories. Each row in the file will
  represent a single Uniq Factory.

## Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to guide developers through the process of efficiently creating multiple Uniq Factories
using the Ultra Tool Kit. By following this step-by-step guide, you will learn how to prepare a CSV file that allows for
the bulk creation of Uniq Factories, reducing the need for manual input and ensuring consistency across all your
entries. This method is particularly useful for large-scale operations where numerous Uniq Factories need to be deployed
quickly and accurately.

## Accessing the Tool Kit

To access the Ultra Tool Kit, please visit: https://toolkit.ultra.io

Once you're on the Tool Kit homepage, click on the network selection component on the top right of your screen.

![](../../fundamentals/images/toolkit-network-selection.png)

Clicking on the network selection component will open up a list of available networks that you can use the toolkit on.
For the sake of this tutorial, we will be using the Ultra Testnet. From the list of available networks, click on
`Testnet`.

![](../../fundamentals/images/toolkit-network-selection-modal.png)

Login to the Ultra Tool Kit using Ultra Wallet. Refer
to [Tutorial - Log in to the Ultra Tool Kit](../../fundamentals/tutorial-login-to-toolkit.md) for more information.

## Creating Multiple Uniq Factories

### 1. Accessing Bulk Factory Creation

Once you've logged in to the tool kit, from the tool kit home page, click on the `Bulk Factory Creation` from the
sidebar, to open the creation tool.

![](./images/toolkit-bulk-factory-creation-tab.png)

### 2. Preparing CSV Template

The first step is to prepare your CSV file. This file will contain all the properties required to create each Uniq
Factory. You can download a CSV Template from the Tool Kit on the `Bulk Factory Creation` page:

![](./images/toolkit-bulk-factory-creation-csv-template.png)

Here’s an example of what your CSV file might look like:

| memo       | asset_manager | asset_creator | minimum_resell_price | mintable_window_start | mintable_window_end | trading_window_start | trading_window_end | recall_window_start | recall_window_end | max_mintable_tokens | lock_hash | lockup_time | stat | account_minting_limit | transfer_window_start | transfer_window_end | maximum_uos_payment | factory_uri | factory_hash                                                     | default_token_uri | default_token_hash                                               | resale_shares_1  | resale_shares_2  | resale_shares_3 | resale_shares_4 | resale_shares_5 | conditionless_receivers_1 | conditionless_receivers_2 | conditionless_receivers_3 | conditionless_receivers_4 | conditionless_receivers_5 | authorized_minters_1 | authorized_minters_2 | authorized_minters_3 | authorized_minters_4 | authorized_minters_5 |

**Note**: Empty cells in the CSV are treated as null fields, meaning those properties will not be set for the
corresponding Uniq Factory.

Each column in your CSV corresponds to a specific parameter in the `create.b` action as described in
the [create.b action documentation](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/create.b.md). Here's a
breakdown of each field:

Based on
the [Ultra developer documentation](https://developers.ultra.io/blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/create.b.html#create-b)
for the `create.b` action, I've added the "Required" column to indicate whether each parameter is mandatory or optional.

These columns in your CSV template represent the necessary inputs to create multiple Uniq Factories using Ultra's
`create.b` action efficiently. Each column directly maps to a specific parameter in the smart contract, ensuring that
the factories are created with all the required settings.

### 3. Uploading the CSV File

Once your CSV file is ready, you can upload it to the Ultra Tool Kit for processing.

1. **Log in** to your Ultra Tool Kit account.
2. **Click** on "Bulk Factory Creation"
3. **Upload** your CSV file.

After uploading, the Ultra Tool Kit will parse the CSV file and begin processing each line. Each row in the CSV file is
translated into a transaction on the blockchain. The `create.b` action is applied to each row, creating a new Uniq
Factory

### 4. Review `create.b` Actions

Once you have uploaded, click on the `Create (x) Action` button and it will open up the transaction confirmation modal.
You can click on the `Details` button to view the transaction in JSON form. Click on the `Confirm` button to submit your
transaction.

![](./images/toolkit-bulk-factory-creation-review.png)

Confirm and sign the transaction using the Ultra Wallet extension. This step is crucial as it authorizes the blockchain
to execute the transfer under your account.

![](./images/ultra-wallet-sign-create-b-tx.png)

After signing the transaction, you will see a confirmation screen indicating that the transaction was successfully
completed. To check the transaction on the block explorer, click on the `View in Explorer` text.

![](./images/toolkit-tx-success-modal.png)

You'll find a list of actions on the block explorer transaction page. Since this is a bulk operation, a single
transaction will contain multiple actions, each corresponding to the creation of a separate Uniq Factory. Look for the
text that says RAM purchase for creating token factory <FACTORY_ID>. Each of these lines will display the ID for a newly
created Uniq Factory. For instance, if you created multiple factories, you might see texts like RAM purchase for
creating token factory 4356, RAM purchase for creating token factory 4357, and so on. The IDs are sequential and
correspond to the order of entries in your CSV file. You’ll need these IDs for upcoming guides.

![](./images/toolkit-bulk-factory-creation-block-explorer.png)

### 5. Verifying Factory Creation

1. To verify the successful creation of your Uniq Factory, go to the `Factory Explorer` page on the tool
   kit (https://toolkit.ultra.io/uniqFactory).
2. Make sure you are using the Ultra Testnet environment.
3. Use the factory ID you obtained in the previous step to search for your Uniq Factory. Simply enter the ID and click
   the search button. You should then be able to view the details of your Uniq Factory.

![](./images/toolkit-factory-explorer-page.png)

You have now successfully created your Uniq Factories using the Ultra Tool Kit.

## What's next?

Once you have created your Uniq Factories, the next step is to mint your first Uniq.
Refer [How to mint a Uniq using the Ultra Tool Kit](./how-to-mint-uniq-using-toolkit.md).

# How to create a Uniq Factory using the Ultra Tool Kit

![](/images/token-factories/new-token-factory.png)

## Prerequisites

-   You must have created and uploaded the uniq metadata files. See [How to create Uniq Metadata](./how-to-create-uniq-metadata.md) for more information.
-   Your account must have sufficient UOS tokens for transactions and fees. Refer to [Tutorial - Using the Faucet and Buying RAM on Ultra Testnet](../../fundamentals/tutorial-obtain-token-and-purchase-ram.md#obtaining-uos-tokens-using-the-faucet) for more information.

## Goal

The goal of this guide is to help you create your first Uniq Factory on the Ultra Testnet network.

## Accessing the Tool Kit

To access the Ultra Tool Kit, please visit: https://toolkit.ultra.io

Once you're on the Tool Kit homepage, click on the network selection component on the top right of your screen.

![](../../fundamentals/images/toolkit-network-selection.png)

Clicking on the network selection component will open up a list of available networks that you can use the toolkit on. For the sake of this tutorial, we will be using the Ultra Testnet. From the list of available networks, click on `Testnet`.

![](../../fundamentals/images/toolkit-network-selection-modal.png)

Login to the Ultra Tool Kit using Ultra Wallet. Refer to [Tutorial - Log in to the Ultra Tool Kit](../../fundamentals/tutorial-login-to-toolkit.md) for more information.

## Creating Uniq Factory

### 1. Accessing Factory Management Page

Once you've logged in to the tool kit, from the tool kit home page, click on the `Uniq Actions` from the sidebar, and then click on `Factory` to open the factory management page.

![](./images/toolkit-factory-actions-tab.png)

On the factory page, search for `create` action in the search box, and click on the `Create token factory (eosio.nft.ft::create.b)` action to open up the transaction modal.

### 2. Configure `create.b` Action

We are going to use the `create.b` action to create the uniq factory. For more information on the action, refer to [create.b action documentation](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/create.b.md).

For the sake of this guide, we will create a uniq factory with the simplest possible configuration.

Once you have opened the transaction modal, fill the required fields for the `create.b` action:

-   **Memo**: Required, enter a text memo for your transaction. For example, `Creating first uniq factory`.

![](./images/toolkit-create-b-tx-form.png)

Once you have inputted all the values, click on the `Send 1 Action` button and it will open up the transaction confirmation modal. You can click on the `Details` button to view the transaction in JSON form. Click on the `Confirm` button to submit your transaction.

![](./images/toolkit-create-b-tx-confirmation.png)

Confirm and sign the transaction using the Ultra Wallet extension. This step is crucial as it authorizes the blockchain to execute the transfer under your account.

![](./images/ultra-wallet-sign-create-b-tx.png)

After signing the transaction, you will see a confirmation screen indicating that the transaction was successfully completed. To check the transaction on the block explorer, click on the `View in Explorer` text.

![](./images/toolkit-tx-success-modal.png)

You'll find an actions list on the block explorer transaction page. Look for the text that says `RAM purchase for creating token factory <FACTORY_ID>`. This text will display the ID for your newly created Uniq factory. For instance, in our example, the text showed `RAM purchase for creating token factory 4356`, meaning our Uniq factory ID was `4356`. Identify the Uniq factory ID for your factory in the same manner. **You'll need this ID for the upcoming guides.**

![](./images/block-exp-create-b-tx-actions.png)

### 3. Verifying Factory Creation

1. To verify the successful creation of your Uniq Factory, go to the `Factory Explorer` page on the tool kit (https://toolkit.ultra.io/uniqFactory).
2. Make sure you are using the Ultra Testnet environment.
3. Use the factory ID you obtained in the previous step to search for your Uniq Factory. Simply enter the ID and click the search button. You should then be able to view the details of your Uniq Factory.

![](./images/toolkit-factory-explorer-page.png)

You have now successfully created your first uniq factory using the Ultra Tool Kit.

## What's next?

Once you have created your first uniq factory, the next step is to mint your first uniq. Refer [How to mint a Uniq using the Ultra Tool Kit](./how-to-mint-uniq-using-toolkit.md).

# How to create Uniq Metadata

Uniqs are tokens that can be associated with anything; games, assets, keys, items, and much more. The data that represents those things _is the metadata_. The title, the descriptions, and the images are all metadata.

Ultra has a specific format for how we expect metadata to be organized.

## Prerequisites

-   A basic understanding of [Factory Metadata](../uniq-variants/factory-metadata.md), [Default Uniq Metadata](../uniq-variants/uniq-default-metadata.md) and [Uniq Metadata](../uniq-variants/uniq-metadata.md).
-   You will need a Google account to make a copy of the [Metadata Template Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gi0iuJis-riKkyhYgMRYVnhGD6PbjvBv8U7lhRwdhNk/edit?usp=sharing).
-   A Windows, Linux or MacOS machine to run the metadata tool on.

## Goal

The goal of this guide is to help you create JSON metadata files for your first Uniq Factory.

## What is Metadata Tool?

The metadata tool simplifies the process for creating metadata for complicated uniq factories and associated uniqs by allowing the user to specify uniq factory specifications and corresponding uniq(s) specifications in an easy to use CSV template.

Metadata tool takes CSVs and media files (Uniq images, videos and other supported media files) as inputs, converts to files to JSON objects, validates the JSON data, generates SHA256 hashes of the JSON objects and outputs the generated metadata JSON files.

![Metadata Tool](/images/token-factories/metadatatool.png)

_It is important to highlight that the metadata tool itself does not interact with the blockchain; instead, it streamlines the creation of metadata for complex uniq factories and their associated uniqs._

## Obtaining Metadata Tool

1. Download the binary/executable for the latest version of the tool from [here](https://github.com/ultraio/metadata-tool/releases).

## Setup Metadata Tool

1. Create a `config.json` file in the same directory as your binary/executable.

![](./images/metadata-tool-config-placement.png)

The configuration file (`config.json`) is a JSON object that allows user to map environment names to their corresponding base URIs. Each environment corresponds to a specific environment in which the metadata and media file for a Uniq factory and associated uniq(s) are to be be hosted/uploaded.

Here's an example of what the config file _might_ look like:

```json
{
    "production": "https://www.my-nft-website.com",
    "staging": "https://staging.my-nft-website.com",
    "mys3bucket": "https://s3.us-east-1.foobar.com",
    "custom": "https://www.my-custom-env.com"
}
```

In the example above, the `production`, `staging`, `mys3bucket` and `custom` environments are mapped to their corresponding base URIs. When the tool is run, it will read the config file and will prompt the user to select either one of the provided environments. The corresponding URI for the selected environment will be used as _base URI_ for the generated factory and uniq(s).

Note that the environments and base URIs in the config file shown above are just examples, and you should replace them with the actual environment(s) for your use-case.

### What qualifies as a valid environment URL?

In theory, any service capable of serving JSON and media content over **predictable URLs** should work. A predictable URL is one where the URL structure follows a consistent and recognizable pattern, making it easy to infer the URL for different files based on their location and names. The general structure of the predictable URLs is:

`Base URI + Collection Name + File Name`

For example:

-   Base URI: `www.my-uniq.com`
-   Collection Name: `Angry Bananas`
-   File Name: `factory.json`, `1.json`, `product.png` etc

Predictable URLs:

-   `www.my-uniq.com/AngryBananas/factory.json`
-   `www.my-uniq.com/AngryBananas/1.json`
-   `www.my-uniq.com/AngryBananas/product.png`

#### ✔️ Example of a valid environment URL:

An AWS S3 bucket is a good example of a valid environment to host your metadata files since the URLs are predictable and follow this pattern:

-   `https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/AngryBananas/factory.json`
-   `https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/AngryBananas/1.json`

In this case, if you know the bucket name and the file name, you can easily predict the URL. Example of a config file using an AWS S3 bucket is:

```json
{
    "production": "https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/",
    "staging": "https://s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/"
}
```

#### ❌ Example of an invalid environment URL:

On the other hand, Dropbox does not provide predictable URLs. When uploading files to the same folder in Dropbox, the URL prefixes are different and not easily predictable. For example:

-   `https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/o0mlbvyjroktfj6r0g3gn/factory.json?rlkey=f70l90yj01d61c0m8j43yt2pm&st=ss8gx8vj&dl=0`
-   `https://dl.dropbox.com/scl/fi/u2s3b2u5mahefssuzyut7/1.json?rlkey=td31270rsy6sfzwgi3sq2rqyr&st=8dqgyg1b&dl=0`

In this case, even though the files are in the same folder, the URL structure is not consistent and cannot be easily inferred.

For our needs, we require a service that allows us to predict the URL prefix. This is important so that we can use these URLs in our configuration file without having to manually update each one.

---

For the sake of this guide, we'll be creating a `config.json` that looks like this:

```json
{
    "developerDocs": "https://developers.ultra.io/uniq-collections/",
    "myS3Bucket": "https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/"
}
```

**Note**: If you do not provide a config file, the tool will prompt you to enter a base URI manually.

Once you have obtained the tool and created your config file, the next step is to setup the folder structure along with the media files, followed by adding data to the CSV template.

## Setup Folder Structure

Create a directory for your Uniq collection and its associated metadata. For simplicity's sake, we're going to create a flat structure and use a single directory that contains all the relevant media files and the metadata.

```
AngryBananas/ 📁 (This is your Root Folder)
|- factory.csv
|- tokens.csv
|- square.png
|- product.png
|- hero.png
|- gallery.png
```

We provide a template example for you to use in the context of this guide.

[![Download](/images/token-factories/download.png)](/zip/AngryBananas.zip)

## Setup CSV Template

Before we start using the CSV template, it is important to understand how the media file paths work in the CSV template, as well as which media types are supported.

### Image/Media Paths

There are two ways to link to an image/media file in your CSV file. One is _relative path_, and the other is an _external HTTP or HTTPS address_.

-   Relative Path: `./product.png` (Relative to your root folder)
-   External: `https://some-external-website.com/product.png`

### Supported Media Types

Metadata tool currently only supports the follow media types:

-   `jpg` / `jpeg`
-   `png`
-   `bmp`
-   `gif`
-   `webp`
-   `mp4`
-   `webm`

### Supported Token URI Template

The CSV template supports two pre defined URI templates for the default Uniq and all other the Uniqs in the factory.
There are two options available: `{hash}` and `{serial_number}`.

-   If `{hash}` is selected, the URI structure for Uniqs will be: `https://{baseUri}/{collectionName}/{hash}.json`.

    For example:

    -   Default Uniq: `https://www.my-uniq.com/AngryBananas/6a42bd...b39974687c2.json`
    -   Uniqs: `https://www.my-uniq.com/AngryBananas/983750...6a3ef645d0eafe.json`

-   If `{serial_number}` is selected, the URI structure for Uniqs will be: `https://{baseUri}/{collectionName}/{serial_number}.json`.

    For example:

    -   Default Uniq: `https://www.my-uniq.com/AngryBananas/{serial_number}.json`
    -   Uniqs: `https://www.my-uniq.com/AngryBananas/1.json`, `https://www.my-uniq.com/AngryBananas/2.json` etc

### Adding Data to the CSV Template

The next step is to add data to the CSV template.

1.  Open [Google Sheets Metadata Tool Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Gi0iuJis-riKkyhYgMRYVnhGD6PbjvBv8U7lhRwdhNk/edit?usp=sharing) and go to `File -> Make a Copy` to make a copy in your own Google Drive.
2.  Open the copied CSV template in your Google Drive and begin modifications of individual fields.

    The first sheet, called `Notes`, includes information regarding the template. This is important to read as this will help you understand the structure, rules, and limitations of the CSV template.

    All columns on the CSV template are color coded to help you understand the template better.

    -   <span style="color:red">**Red**</span> indicates that the column value is required and must be provided.
    -   <span style="color:blue">**Blue**</span> indicates that the column value is optional and can be skipped.
    -   <span style="color:yellow">**Yellow**</span> indicates the column value is pre-defined, and will be filled out automatically. You do not need to provide any input to such columns.
    -   <span style="color:orange">**Orange**</span> indicates that user should either provide values for both columns, or, should leave both columns blank. Such columns will always be in pair of two.

        ![](./images/metadata-tool-csv-template-notes.png)

    There are two more sheets in the CSV template, called `Factory` and `Tokens`.

#### Adding Factory Data

1. To add factory data, go to the factory sheet by clicking on `Factory` from the sheets list.
2. Add the data to the following columns:
    - `specVersion`: Auto-filled, this column will be automatically filled once you provide a collection name.
    - `name`: Required, the name of your collection.
    - `Token URI Template`: Required, select either `{serial_number}` or `{hash}`. Refer to [Supported Token URI Template](#supported-token-uri-template) for more information.
    - `subName`: Optional, a sub name for the collection.
    - `description`: Optional, a description for the collection.
    - `author`: Optional, name of the author.
    - `defaultLocale`: Auto-filled, this column will be automatically filled once you provide a collection name.
    - `product`: Required, the relative path, or external URL to the product media file for the factory.
    - `square`: Required, the relative path, or external URL to the square media file for the factory.
    - `hero`: Optional, the relative path, or external URL to the hero media file for the factory.
    - `gallery 1`: Optional, the relative path, or external URL to the first gallery media file for the factory. You can include up to 12 gallery images by using the columns labeled `gallery 1`, `gallery 2`, `gallery 3`, and so on.
    - `Att Type 1`: Optional, the data type of the first attribute of this collection. You can double click on this column to choose from a list of pre-defined data types.
        - `Att Name 1`: Required if `Att Type 1` was provided. The name of the attribute.
        - `Att Desc 1`: Optional, a description for the attribute.
        - You can include up to 12 attributes by using the columns labeled `Att Type 1` `Att Name 1` `Att Desc 1`, `Att Type 2` `Att Name 2` `Att Desc 2`, and so on.

![](./images/metadata-tool-csv-template-factory-attrbs.png)

3.  Once you're done filling out data in the `Factory` sheet, export the `Factory` sheet as a CSV file by clicking on `File -> Download -> Comma Separated Values (.csv)`
    ![](./images/metadata-tool-csv-template-export-as-csv.png)
4.  Rename the downloaded CSV file to `factory.csv` and place in your root folder. (Refer to [Setup Folder Structure](#setup-folder-structure) step)

#### Adding Uniq Data

1. To add data for uniqs, go to the uniqs sheet by clicking on `Tokens` from the sheets list. You can add the desired number of uniqs to your factory by adding a new row for each uniq that you want to create.
2. Add the data to the following columns:
    - `serialNumber`: For the first uniq, you can select `default` if you want to create a [default uniq](../uniq-variants/uniq-default-metadata.md), or you can select `1`, if you do not want to create a default uniq. If you select the `default` option, the next uniq that you add will be assigned serial number `1`. It is important to highlight that <ins>serial numbers are automatically generated</ins> for each uniq that you add to the collection.
    - `specVersion`: Auto-filled, this column will be automatically filled once you provide a uniq name.
    - `name`: Required, the name of your uniq.
    - `subName`: Optional, a sub name for the uniq.
    - `description`: Optional, a description for the uniq.
    - `author`: Auto-filled using the `author` column value provided in `Factory` sheet.
    - `defaultLocale`: Auto-filled, this column will be automatically filled once you provide a uniq name.
    - `product`: Required, the relative path, or external URL to the product media file for the Uniq.
    - `square`: Required, the relative path, or external URL to the square media file for the Uniq.
    - `hero`: Optional, the relative path, or external URL to the hero media file for the Uniq.
    - `gallery 1`: Optional, the relative path, or external URL to the first gallery media file for the Uniq. You can include up to 12 gallery images by using the columns labeled `gallery 1`, `gallery 2`, `gallery 3`, and so on.
    - `Att Name 1`: Optional, the data type of the first attribute of this collection. You can double click on this column to choose from a list of pre-defined data types.
        - `Att Name 1`: Auto-filled using the data provided in the `Factory` sheet.
        - `Att Val 1`: Required if the data for `Att Name 1` exists. This column represents the attribute value for the specific attribute defined in `Factory` sheet.
        - If you have included additional attributes in the `Factory` sheet, you must provide a value for each attribute.

![](./images/metadata-tool-csv-template-tokens-data-added.png)
![](./images/metadata-tool-csv-template-tokens-attrbs.png)

3.  Once you're done filling out data in the `Tokens` sheet, export the `Tokens` sheet as a CSV file by clicking on `File -> Download -> Comma Separated Values (.csv)`
4.  Rename the downloaded CSV file to `tokens.csv` and place in your root folder.

<!-- ### Running the tool: -->

## Running the Metadata Tool

Once you have set up your folder structure and created the CSVs for factory and uniqs, the next step is to run the metadata tool. Before we begin, please note the following:

-   A report is always generated during runtime, but it is only saved to a file once you close the tool.
-   Reports will help you debug your CSV files; any missing information will be noted in the report and sometimes in the terminal/console window.

### Starting the Tool

Starting the tool is different for each operating system. Follow the steps for your operating system:

#### Windows

On Windows you can drag and drop your collection root folder onto the executable. Or, you can open the metadata tool by simply double clicking the executable.

#### Linux

Follow these steps to run the linux binary:

1.  `cd` to the directory where metadata tool binary is present.

2.  Make it executable by running this command in your terminal:

    `sudo chmod +x metadata-tool-v1-4-8-linux`

3.  Start the tool by running this command in your terminal:

    `./metadata-tool-v1-4-8-linux`

#### MacOS

Follow these steps to run the MacOS binary:

1.  `cd` to the directory where metadata tool binary is present.

2.  Make it executable by running this command in your terminal:

    `sudo chmod +x metadata-tool-v1-4-8-macos`

3.  `Ctrl` + `Right Click` on the binary/executable and then click `Open`. It will ask you if you want to open it. Click on `Open` again.
    ![](./images/metadata-tool-macos-warning.png)

### Working Directory Input

Once you have started the metadata tool, it will prompt you to enter the path to your root folder. Enter the relative, or absolute path to your collection root folder, and press `Enter` key to submit.

![](./images/metadata-tool-path-prompt.png)

We have used the relative path `../AngryBananas` here because on our system the `AngryBananas` directory exists at `../`, relative to the metadata tool executable. You should use the relative path depending on where your collection root directory exists. Or, you can also use the full absolute path to your collection root directory.

On Windows if your metadata tool executable is next to the root directory then you can just enter the root directory name like `AngryBananas` and it will also work.

### Environment Selection

You will now be prompted to select betweens the environments that you have specified in the config file. Use arrow keys to select the desired environment, and press `Enter` key to proceed.

![](./images/metadata-tool-env-prompt.png)

### File Validation and Processing

Metadata tool will now process and validate the CSV files to generate the JSON metadata. If successful, you will see the success message. If there are some errors, they will be printed on the screen.

![](./images/metadata-tool-finished.png)

Press the `Enter` key to exit and close the metadata tool. Once closed, a report will be generated in the folder where your metadata tool binary/executable is located. A sample report looks like this:

```
[02:29:34] Started Metadata Tool v1.4.8

[02:29:36] Finished Processing. Press [Enter] to Exits
```

### Generated Metadata Files

If there were no errors, the metadata tool will create the following files in the collection's root directory, and your root directory should be similar to:

```
AngryBananas/ 📁 (This is your Root Folder)
 |-generated_media/ 📁
 | |-51aa8699ebc19560234ce8db808e13f88069784c925838157a4d33da486742d9.png
 | |-9a4a2560f581f3982ce9c6daf58d0da673432868cd16b2191ce279d8a8ae4c01.png
 | |-d602c91d1a14a8e91ac6033f56fcdcaacf99d60de8c73ebc79d5dcb6fd56d6d0.png

 |-{serial_number}.json
 |-1.json
 |-2.json
 |-factory.csv
 |-gallery.png
 |-hero.png
 |-product.png
 |-square.png
 |-tokens.csv
 |-upload.json
```

-   `factory.json`: The JSON metadata file for the uniq factory.
-   `defaultToken.json`: The JSON metadata file for the default uniq, if a default uniq was specified in the CSV template. In this guide the `defaultToken.json` will be unused because the `default_token_uri` of the factory will later be replaced with the template URI of individual Uniqs using `{serial_number}`. The same would apply to `{hash}` template value.
-   `1.json`: The JSON metadata file for uniq with serial number 1, and so on, for each uniq specified in the CSV template.
    -   If you specified `{hash}` as the `Token URI Template`, then your uniq metadata files will be named as the SHA256 hash of their file contents.
-   `generated_media`: This directory contains all the media files. Each file is renamed as the SHA256 hash of its content.
-   `upload.json`: The `upload.json` file contains the details regarding the uniq collection. Such as the collection name, factory/uniq hashes & URLs, and media URLs.

### Output File Explained

It is important to understand that the `upload.json` file <ins>is not part of the actual metadata</ins>, rather it is generated as a help for you to understand where you _should_ upload/host the generated metadata files.

For our example collection, the `upload.json` file should look like this:

```json
{
    "collectionName": "Angry Bananas",
    "factory": {
        "hash": "90e382c9212e4e44a6958ec6f9add375c93efa8c731fb495cd6f551594df7756",
        "url": "https://developers.ultra.io/uniq-collections/AngryBananas/90e382c9212e4e44a6958ec6f9add375c93efa8c731fb495cd6f551594df7756.json"
    },
    "defaultToken": {
        "hash": "255cb93b1f53ff9ec1d4c5b5d8bff1fc2c6661c847cd2fd3b3376640483d510a",
        "url": "https://developers.ultra.io/uniq-collections/AngryBananas/{serial_number}.json"

### 2. Configure `issue.b` Action

We are going to use the `issue.b` action to mint a uniq. For more information on the action, refer to [issue.b action documentation](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/issue.b.md).

Once you have opened the transaction modal, fill the required fields for the `issue.b` action:

-   **To**: Required, the recipient of the minted token. Input your account if you want to receive the minted uniq in your wallet.
-   **Token configs**: Click `Add` to input the `Token factory ID`, `Amount`, and `Custom data`.
    -   **Token factory ID**: Required, the ID of the factory from which the uniqs will be minted. Use the ID of the uniq factory created in the previous guide. Refer to [How to create a Uniq Factory using the Ultra Tool Kit](./how-to-create-uniq-factory-using-toolkit.md) for more information.
    -   **Amount**: Required, the number of uniqs to be minted. For the sake of this guide, we will mint `1` uniq.
    -   **Custom data**: Deprecated, leave blank.
-   **Memo**: Required, enter a text memo for your transaction. For example, `Minting my first uniq`.
-   **Authorizer**: Optional, the authorizer of the mint. Must be one of authorized minters of the factory. Leave blank to use `null`.
-   **Maximum UOS payment**: Maximum amount of UOS that is allowed to be used for the purposes of contract RAM usage. For simplicity's sake, we will Leave blank to use `null`.
-   **Token metadata**: Click `Add` to input the `Metadata URI` and `Metadata hash`.
    -   **Metadata URI**: Required, the URI of the token metadata. We are using `https://developers.ultra.io/uniq-collections/AngryBananas/1.json`, based on the metadata we created during the [How to create Uniq metadata](./how-to-create-uniq-metadata.md) guide.
    -   **Metadata hash**: Optional, hash of the token metadata. We are using `2da6b5b4d8ecf25ac3b472c16264b02c48d35833196a262db562ea988e34417f`, based on the metadata we created during previous guides.

![](./images/toolkit-issue-b-tx-form.png)

Once you have inputted all the values, click on the `Send 1 Action` button and it will open up the transaction confirmation modal. You can click on the `Details` button to view the transaction in JSON form. Click on the `Confirm` button to submit your transaction.

# How to update metadata using the Ultra Tool Kit

An important aspect of the Ultra NFT standard is the ability to update metadata. Game publishers may want to modify a uniq's traits based on in-game events.

For this guide, we will use the uniq factory and uniq token created in the previous steps, utilizing the Ultra Testnet network.

## Prerequisites

-   You must have already created and uploaded the metadata files. Refer to [How to create Uniq Metadata](./how-to-create-uniq-metadata.md) for more information.
-   You must have already created a uniq factory. Refer to [How to create a Uniq Factory using the Ultra Tool Kit](./how-to-create-uniq-factory-using-toolkit.md) for more information.
-   Your account must have sufficient UOS tokens for transactions and fees. Refer to [Tutorial - Using the Faucet and Buying RAM on Ultra Testnet](../../fundamentals/tutorial-obtain-token-and-purchase-ram.md#obtaining-uos-tokens-using-the-faucet) for more information.
-   Ensure your account is the uniq factory manager for the uniq factory whose metadata you intend to update, as only the uniq factory manager is authorized to perform metadata related updates.

## Goal

The goal of this guide is to help you understand how you can update the metadata using Ultra Tool Kit. This guide is divided into three sections:

1. **Updating Uniq Factory Metadata**: Will walk you through the process of updating metadata for a uniq factory.
2. **Updating Default Uniq Metadata**: Will walk you through the process of updating metadata for the default uniq.
3. **Updating Uniq Metadata**: Will walk you through the process of updating metadata for a specific uniq.

## Updating Uniq Factory Metadata

If a content creator re-uploads a new uniq factory metadata, they can use the `setmeta.b` action to update the metadata for the uniq factory. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Login to Ultra Tool Kit using your account.
2. Navigate to the factory management page by clicking on the `Uniq Actions` from the sidebar, and then clicking on `Factory`.
3. On the factory page, search for `setmeta` action in the search box, and click on the `Set factory metadata (eosio.nft.ft::setmeta.b)` action to open up the transaction modal.

![](./images/toolkit-factory-actions-tab-setmeta.png)

### Configure `setmeta.b` Action

We will use the `setmeta.b` action to update the metadata for a uniq factory. For more information on the action, refer to [setmeta.b action documentation](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/setmeta.b.md).

Once you have opened the transaction modal, fill the required fields for the `setmeta.b` action:

1. **Token factory ID**: Required, the ID of the uniq factory for which you want to update the metadata.
2. **Memo**: Required, enter a text memo for your transaction. For example, `updating uniq factory metadata`.
3. **Metadata URI**: Required, URI of the new/updated factory metadata JSON file.
4. **Metadata hash**: Required, SHA256 hash of the new/updated metadata JSON file.

![](./images/toolkit-setmeta-b-tx-form.png)

Once you have inputted all the values, click on the `Send 1 Action` button and it will open up the transaction confirmation modal. You can click on the `Details` button to view the transaction in JSON form. Click on the `Confirm` button to submit your transaction.

![](./images/toolkit-setmeta-b-tx-confirmation.png)

Confirm and sign the transaction using the Ultra Wallet extension.

![](./images/ultra-wallet-sign-setmeta-b-tx.png)

After signing the transaction, you will see a confirmation screen indicating that the transaction was successfully completed.

![](./images/toolkit-tx-success-modal.png)

You have now successfully updated the metadata for a uniq factory.

## Updating Default Uniq Metadata

Default uniq metadata is used as a fallback mechanism whenever there's no metadata available for a uniq. To update the default uniq metadata, follow these steps:

1. Login to Ultra Tool Kit using your account.
2. Navigate to the factory management page by clicking on the `Uniq Actions` from the sidebar, and then clicking on `Factory`.
3. On the factory page, search for `setdflttkn` action in the search box, and click on the `Set default token metadata (eosio.nft.ft::setdflttkn)` action to open up the transaction modal.

![](./images/toolkit-factory-actions-tab-setdflttkn.png)

### Configure `setdflttkn` Action

We will use the `setdflttkn` action to update the metadata for a uniq factory. For more information on the action, refer to [setdflttkn action documentation](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/setdflttkn.md).

Once you have opened the transaction modal, fill the required fields for the `setdflttkn` action:

2. **Memo**: Required, enter a text memo for your transaction. For example, `updating default uniq metadata`.
3. **Metadata URI**: Required, URI of the new/updated default uniq metadata JSON file.
4. **Metadata hash**: SHA256 hash of the new/updated default uniq metadata JSON file.
    - If you are using a dynamic metadata URI (e.g., https://developers.ultra.io/uniq-collections/AngryBananas/{serial_number}.json), you should leave this field blank.
    - If you are using a static metadata URI (e.g., https://developers.ultra.io/uniq-collections/AngryBananas/ffc3121613cc7d52a3525bb68c0948edc469f6f2c16bcb7b6b7fa38f7eaed3cf.json), this field is required.

![](./images/toolkit-setdflttkn-tx-form.png)

Once you have inputted all the values, click on the `Send 1 Action` button and it will open up the transaction confirmation modal. You can click on the `Details` button to view the transaction in JSON form. Click on the `Confirm` button to submit your transaction.

![](./images/toolkit-setdflttkn-tx-confirmation.png)

Confirm and sign the transaction using the Ultra Wallet extension.

![](./images/ultra-wallet-sign-setdflttkn-tx.png)

After signing the transaction, you will see a confirmation screen indicating that the transaction was successfully completed.

![](./images/toolkit-tx-success-modal.png)

You have now successfully updated the default uniq metadata.

## Updating Uniq Metadata

To update the uniq metadata, follow these steps:

1. Login to Ultra Tool Kit using your account.
2. Navigate to the uniq manager page by clicking on the `Uniq Actions` from the sidebar, and then clicking on `Uniq`.
3. On the uniq page, search for `settknmeta` action in the search box, and click on the `Set token metadata (eosio.nft.ft::settknmeta)` action to open up the transaction modal.

![](./images/toolkit-uniq-actions-tab-settknmeta.png)

### Configure `settknmeta` Action

We will use the `settknmeta` action to update the metadata for a uniq. For more information on the action, refer to [settknmeta action documentation](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/settknmeta.md).

Once you have opened the transaction modal, fill the required fields for the `settknmeta` action:

1. **Token ID**: Required, the ID of the uniq for which you want to update the metadata.
2. **Owner**: Required, the account that owns this uniq.
3. **Memo**: Required, enter a text memo for your transaction. For example, `updating default uniq metadata`.
4. **Metadata URI**: Optional, URI of the new/updated uniq metadata JSON file.
5. **Metadata hash**: Optional, SHA256 hash of the new/updated uniq metadata JSON file.

![](./images/toolkit-settknmeta-tx-form.png)

Once you have inputted all the values, click on the `Send 1 Action` button and it will open up the transaction confirmation modal. You can click on the `Details` button to view the transaction in JSON form. Click on the `Confirm` button to submit your transaction.

![](./images/toolkit-settknmeta-tx-confirmation.png)

![](./images/ultra-wallet-sign-settknmeta-tx.png)

After signing the transaction, you will see a confirmation screen indicating that the transaction was successfully completed.

![](./images/toolkit-tx-success-modal.png)

You have now successfully updated the metadata for a uniq.

## Disabling Metadata Changes

For certain use cases, it might make sense to make the uniq factory immutable. For such cases, we can use the `lckfactory` action to enable a manager to disable any metadata updates. This can be particularly useful for an NFT art gallery, as it assures users that their artwork will never change.

**Before we proceed, it is important to note that this change is irreversible**.

To disable metadata updates for a uniq factory, follow these steps:

1. Login to Ultra Tool Kit using your account.
2. Navigate to the factory management page by clicking on the `Uniq Actions` from the sidebar, and then clicking on `Factory`.
3. On the factory page, search for `lckfactory` action in the search box, and click on the `Lock factory (eosio.nft.ft::lckfactory)` action to open up the transaction modal.

![](./images/toolkit-factory-actions-tab-lckfactory.png)

### Configure `lckfactory` Action

We will use the `lckfactory` action to update the metadata for a uniq factory. For more information on the action, refer to [lckfactory action documentation](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/lckfactory.md).

Once you have opened the transaction modal, fill the required fields for the `lckfactory` action:

1. **Token factory ID**: Required, the ID of the uniq factory for which you want to disable metadata updates.

![](./images/toolkit-lckfactory-tx-form.png)

Click on the `Send 1 Action` button and it will open up the transaction confirmation modal. You can click on the `Details` button to view the transaction in JSON form. Click on the `Confirm` button to submit your transaction.

![](./images/toolkit-lckfactory-tx-confirmation.png)

Confirm and sign the transaction using the Ultra Wallet extension.

![](./images/ultra-wallet-sign-lckfactory-tx.png)

After signing the transaction, you will see a confirmation screen indicating that the transaction was successfully completed.

![](./images/toolkit-tx-success-modal.png)

You have now successfully disabled metadata updates for the uniq factory. To verify that the uniq factory is locked for metadata changes, attempt to update the factory, default uniq, or uniq metadata for this factory using the aforementioned actions, and the transaction should fail.

## What's next?

After practicing the basic metadata actions, you can move on to advanced actions with Uniqs and Factories:

# How to validate uniq metadata using Ultra Tool Kit's Schema Validator

Schema validator is a feature of the Ultra Tool Kit that helps you to validate your uniq metadata files.

## Prerequisites

-   You must have created uniq metadata files. See [How to create Uniq Metadata](./how-to-create-uniq-metadata.md) for more information.

## Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to help validate your metadata files using Ultra Tool Kit's schema validator.

## Accessing the Tool Kit

To access the Ultra Tool Kit, please visit: https://toolkit.ultra.io

## Schema Validator

Once on the tool kit home page, click on the `Schema Validator` from the sidebar to open the schema validator page.

![](./images/schema-validator-default.png)

Schema validator allows you to validate the metadata files for both; uniq factories and uniqs.

1. To use the validator, simply select the metadata file of your choice.
2. Specify the schema type; either `Factory` (for uniq factories), or `Uniq` (for default uniq and all other uniqs).
3. Click on the `Validate` button to validate the metadata file.

If the selected metadata file adheres to the specified metadata schema, you will see a `Valid Schema ✔️` message.
![](./images/schema-validator-valid-factory.png)

If your metadata file does not comply with the specified schema, you will see an `Invalid Schema ❌` message. This will be followed by a list of errors detailing what is wrong with your metadata file. Review these errors to identify and correct the issues.
![](./images/schema-validator-invalid-factory.png)

## What's next?

Once you have validated the metadata files for your collection, you can now proceed to create your first uniq factory. Refer to [How to create a Uniq Factory using the Ultra Tool Kit](./how-to-create-uniq-factory-using-toolkit.md).

# Creating Uniq Factories

We will be walking you through the step by step process of creating your own Uniq Factory on Ultra's blockchain using our very own [Uniq NFT Standard](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/index.md). For the sake of these guides, we'll be using the Ultra Testnet network.

![](/images/token-factories/intro.png)

## Prerequisites

-   A basic understanding of [Uniq Factories and Uniqs](../../uniq-factories/index.md).
-   You must have created your Ultra Pro Wallet on testnet.. If you need help creating your Ultra Pro Wallet, please refer to [How to create an Ultra Pro Wallet using Ultra Wallet Extension](../../guides/how-to-create-ultra-pro-wallet-using-toolkit.md) tutorial. Once you have created your account, make sure to [get some UOS tokens for use on Testnet](../../fundamentals/tutorial-obtain-token-and-purchase-ram.md#step-3-request-uos-tokens-from-the-faucet). You'll need these to create Uniq Factories and to mint Uniqs.

## Goal

The goal of these guides is to help you create your first Uniq factory and mint your first Uniq.

## Get Started

Here are the steps to get started, and we will guide you through each one. By the end of these guides, you'll have successfully set up your Uniq Factory and issued your first Uniqs on the Testnet network.

title: 'Exchange a Uniq Using Smart Contract'

order: 5

# Exchange a Uniq Using Smart Contract

## What does "Exchange a Uniq" mean

In this guide, we will cover the possibility of issuing a new Uniq to the user when he burns or transfers some other Uniq. The purpose of such an exchange may be to migrate a user Uniq to a newer factory which may have different set of rules (e.g. Uniqs from new factory can be transferred).

An alternative use case could be if you want to allow users to redeem a Uniq using some "ticket" Uniq which does not have anything useful by itself but can be exchanged for an actual Uniq from a different factory.

Some of the factory's values are immutable after they are created, and when a Uniq is exchanged it provides the opportunity for customers to migrate to a new factory with different values.

## When do you need a smart contract

You won't need a dedicated smart contract for each case where you need to exchange Uniqs. In some cases the first-hand purchase options may be sufficient enough: [factory purchase options](./factory-purchase-options.md#purchase-option-use-cases).

You should consider using the smart contract approach in the following scenarios:
- I want to exchange Uniq only if some specific conditions are met which are not covered by first-hand purchase feature
    - examples include: requiring preregistration using a dedicated smart contract action; having alternative pricing model where you will check that the payment was done using smart contract; 
- I have some automation requirements which requires minimum user input
    - since smart contracts are flexible, you are able to do more things than besides simply minting a Uniq
- There is an extra interaction with other smart contract that needs to happen
    - NFT contract by default notifies only certain accounts about the action execution and if you need to extend this list you will have to rely on your own smart contract to notify other contracts

## Overview of the smart contract

Smart contract provided on this page does and showcases the following:
- Smart contract is notified when token is burnt or transferred
    - Burn notification happens only if contract is deployed to the same account as token factory manager
    - Transfer notification happens for both sender, receiver of the token and the token factory manager
- Smart contract issues a new Uniq from the pre-configured factory to the original owner of the Uniq

To make the contract below work based on your needs, you will need to do some adjustments:
- Change name of the factory manager account to the one appropriate to the factory you are trying to mint from
- Change factory id of the factory you are going to mint from
- Add any necessary preliminary checks before issuing a token
    - You may potentially want to check what token was burnt or transferred (id of the token, serial number of factory id)
    - There could be other requirements that you want to impose, like requiring user to register via some other smart contract action
- Depending on the permission structure and where you put the contract, you may want to add `smart_contract_name@eosio.code` permission under the `factory_manager@active` so that the contract will be able to issue tokens in the name of the factory manager

# Factory Purchase Options Examples

Here, we provide some example `cleos` commands to set purchase options and to purchase using created options. JSON data from provided `cleos` commands can be copied and utilized as a payload for the transaction for your API library of choice.

-   [setprchsreq.b - set purchase requirement](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/setprchsreq.b.md)
-   [purchase.a - purchase a token](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/purchase.a.md)

::: info
Please keep in mind that the factory IDs, token IDs, user group IDs, and account names used throughout this page are not real and must be replaced with the actual data you are interested in.
:::

::: warning
Since `setprchsreq.a` action is deprecated, we will use `setprchsreq.b` action in the following examples.
:::

## Simple UOS/USD pricing

This example utilizes the `price` field to set the price to 50 UOS

::: details setprchsreq.b
```sh
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft setprchsreq.b '[
  {
    "token_factory_id": 100,
    "index": 0,
    "price": "50.00000000 UOS",
    "purchase_limit": null,
    "promoter_basis_point": 100,
    "purchase_option_with_uniqs": null,
    "sale_shares": [],
    "maximum_uos_payment": null,
    "group_restriction": null,
    "purchase_window_start": null,
    "purchase_window_end": null,
    "memo": ""
  }
]' -p factory.manager
```
:::

To be able to purchase from such factory you utilize `purchase.a` action

::: details purchase.a
```sh
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft purchase.a '[
  {
    "token_factory_id": 100,
    "index": 0,
    "max_price": "100.00000000 UOS",
    "buyer": "alice",
    "receiver": "alice",
    "promoter_id": null,
    "user_uniqs": null,
    "memo": ""
  }
]' -p alice
```
:::

This example utilizes the `price` field to set the price to 5 USD

::: details setprchsreq.b
```sh
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft setprchsreq.b '[
  {
    "token_factory_id": 100,
    "index": 1,
    "price": "5.00000000 USD",
    "purchase_limit": null,
    "promoter_basis_point": 100,
    "purchase_option_with_uniqs": null,
    "sale_shares": [],
    "maximum_uos_payment": null,
    "group_restriction": null,
    "purchase_window_start": null,
    "purchase_window_end": null,
    "memo": ""
  }
]' -p factory.manager
```
:::

When purchasing using the option that has USD pricing you still provide `max_price` in UOS. The conversion from the USD price into appropriate UOS price will be done automatically.

::: details purchase.a
```sh
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft purchase.a '[
  {
    "token_factory_id": 100,
    "index": 1,
    "max_price": "100.00000000 UOS",
    "buyer": "alice",
    "receiver": "alice",
    "promoter_id": null,
    "user_uniqs": null,
    "memo": ""
  }
]' -p alice
```
:::

## Limited purchase quantity

Setting `purchase_limit` is optional, and it allows to restrict the total number of tokens that can be purchased using this option. The limit applies to the single option itself and not the accounts that purchase from your factory. So if you set the `purchase_limit` to 10 it means that one account can purchase 10 tokens or five accounts can purchase 2 tokens or ten accounts can purchase 1 token and anything in between.

After exceeding the `purchase_limit`, no one will be able to use this specific purchase option and you either need to create a new purchase option or update an existing one to increase the `purchase_limit` (history for the number of Uniqs purchased is preserved).

::: details setprchsreq.b
```sh
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft setprchsreq.b '[
  {
    "token_factory_id": 100,
    "index": 0,
    "price": "50.00000000 UOS",
    "purchase_limit": 10,
    "promoter_basis_point": 100,
    "purchase_option_with_uniqs": null,
    "sale_shares": [],
    "maximum_uos_payment": null,
    "group_restriction": null,
    "purchase_window_start": null,
    "purchase_window_end": null,
    "memo": ""
  }
]' -p factory.manager
```
:::

## Exclusive access to purchase option via Uniq ownership

`purchase_option_with_uniqs` is a more advanced use case where you are able to link the purchase option to other factories. The example below requires the user to own 1 Uniq from factory with ID 42. If the user owns it then he will be able to use this purchase option, the token from factory 42 will be left untouched. Note how `strategy` is set to 0 ([0 means "check"](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/purchase.a.md#supplying-uniqs-for-purchases)).

::: details setprchsreq.b
```sh
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft setprchsreq.b '[
  {
    "token_factory_id": 100,
    "index": 0,
    "price": "50.00000000 UOS",
    "purchase_limit": null,
    "promoter_basis_point": 100,
    "purchase_option_with_uniqs": {
        "transfer_tokens_receiver_account": null,
        "factories": [{
            "token_factory_id": 42,
            "count": 1,
            "strategy": 0
        }]
    },
    "sale_shares": [],
    "maximum_uos_payment": null,
    "group_restriction": null,
    "purchase_window_start": null,
    "purchase_window_end": null,
    "memo": ""
  }
]' -p factory.manager
```
:::

When purchasing, the transaction needs to specify which token exactly the user shows as a proof of satisfying condition of ownership for the token from factory 42. In this case, assume token 77 was minted from factory 42.

::: details purchase.a
```sh
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft purchase.a '[
  {
    "token_factory_id": 100,
    "index": 0,
    "max_price": "100.00000000 UOS",
    "buyer": "alice",
    "receiver": "alice",
    "promoter_id": null,
    "user_uniqs": {
      "tokens": [{
        "token_id": 77,
        "strategy": 0
      }]
    },
    "memo": ""
  }
]' -p alice
```
:::

## Exclusive access to purchase option via user groups

Alternative condition for allowing direct purchases from the factory can be the usage of user groups ([covered here](../../../blockchain/contracts/user-group-contract/index.md)). In this case user must belong to certain group(s) or not be a part of a specific group(s).

Example below covers the simplest case where a user must belong to the user groups with IDs 11 and 12 at the same time. For more advanced usage, reference the action documentation: [setprchsreq.b user groups support](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/setprchsreq.b.md#example-usage-of-the-parameter-group-restriction)

::: details setprchsreq.b
```sh
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft setprchsreq.b '[
  {
    "token_factory_id": 100,
    "index": 0,
    "price": "50.00000000 UOS",
    "purchase_limit": null,
    "promoter_basis_point": 100,
    "purchase_option_with_uniqs": null,
    "sale_shares": [],
    "maximum_uos_payment": null,
    "group_restriction": "11&12",
    "purchase_window_start": null,
    "purchase_window_end": null,
    "memo": ""
  }
]' -p factory.manager
```
:::

When purchasing no extra input is required from the user, the verification of group's membership will be verified by the smart contract automatically

::: details purchase.a
```sh
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft purchase.a '[
  {
    "token_factory_id": 100,
    "index": 0,
    "max_price": "100.00000000 UOS",
    "buyer": "alice",
    "receiver": "alice",
    "promoter_id": null,
    "user_uniqs": null,
    "memo": ""
  }
]' -p alice
```
:::

## Using purchase option for swapping

"Swapping" in this case implies the process where the user loses ownership of his Uniq, the Uniq gets destroyed in the process and the user gets a new Uniq from the factory instead. The example below requires the user to give up two Uniqs: one from factory 43 and one from factory 44, no additional UOS payment needed. Note how `strategy` is set to 1 ([1 means "burn"](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/purchase.a.md#supplying-uniqs-for-purchases)).

::: details setprchsreq.b
```sh
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft setprchsreq.b '[
  {
    "token_factory_id": 100,
    "index": 0,
    "price": "0.00000000 UOS",
    "purchase_limit": null,
    "promoter_basis_point": 100,
    "purchase_option_with_uniqs": {
        "transfer_tokens_receiver_account": null,
        "factories": [{
            "token_factory_id": 43,
            "count": 1,
            "strategy": 1
        },{
            "token_factory_id": 44,
            "count": 1,
            "strategy": 1
        }]
    },
    "sale_shares": [],
    "maximum_uos_payment": null,
    "group_restriction": null,
    "purchase_window_start": null,
    "purchase_window_end": null,
    "memo": ""
  }
]' -p factory.manager
```
:::

Purchasing from such a purchase option requires the user to specify which Uniqs the user is willing to be given up. Here, assumes token 123 is from factory 43 and token 124 is from factory 44. Note how the `strategy` matches the value of the purchase option.

::: details purchase.a
```sh
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft purchase.a '[
  {
    "token_factory_id": 100,
    "index": 0,
    "max_price": "0.00000000 UOS",
    "buyer": "alice",
    "receiver": "alice",
    "promoter_id": null,
    "user_uniqs": {
      "tokens": [{
        "token_id": 123,
        "strategy": 1
      },{
        "token_id": 124,
        "strategy": 1
      }]
    },
    "memo": ""
  }
]' -p alice
```
:::

## Using purchase option for exchange

Exchanging a Uniq is similar to swapping it but this time instead of a user losing access to his Uniq and burning a Uniq it will simply be transferred to a dedicated account. This may be useful in case Uniqs have valuable metadata attached to them, and you will later utilize those Uniqs in some other scenario. The example below configures the receiver of transferred Uniqs as `1aa2aa3aa4aa` account, and it also must be a Uniq from factory 45 to be able to use this purchase option. Specifying `transfer_tokens_receiver_account` is mandatory in such scenario. Note how `strategy` is set to 2 ([2 means "transfer"](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/purchase.a.md#supplying-uniqs-for-purchases)).

::: details setprchsreq.b
```sh
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft setprchsreq.b '[
  {
    "token_factory_id": 100,
    "index": 0,
    "price": "0.00000000 UOS",
    "purchase_limit": null,
    "promoter_basis_point": 100,
    "purchase_option_with_uniqs": {
        "transfer_tokens_receiver_account": "1aa2aa3aa4aa",
        "factories": [{
            "token_factory_id": 45,
            "count": 1,
            "strategy": 2
        }]
    },
    "sale_shares": [],
    "maximum_uos_payment": null,
    "group_restriction": null,
    "purchase_window_start": null,
    "purchase_window_end": null,
    "memo": ""
  }
]' -p factory.manager
```
:::

Purchasing using the above option is similar to previous examples. User needs to specify which Uniq will be used during the purchase and this Uniq will be transferred to `1aa2aa3aa4aa` at the end. The `strategy`, again, should match the `strategy` specified in the purchase option itself.

::: details purchase.a
```sh
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft purchase.a '[
  {
    "token_factory_id": 100,
    "index": 0,
    "max_price": "0.00000000 UOS",
    "buyer": "alice",
    "receiver": "alice",
    "promoter_id": null,
    "user_uniqs": {
      "tokens": [{
        "token_id": 125,
        "strategy": 2
      }]
    },
    "memo": ""
  }
]' -p alice
```

# Factory Purchase Options

## Overview of factory purchase options feature

First-hand factory purchase options allow users to receive Uniqs from the factory directly without requiring you to manually issue Uniqs to the users. Various configuration options can be set when creating the purchase option for your factory, and in addition to that each factory can have multiple purchase options available. The usage of the actions to create and utilize purchase options is provided below.

-   [setprchsreq.b - set purchase requirement](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/setprchsreq.b.md)
-   [purchase.a - purchase a token](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/purchase.a.md)

The first-hand purchase options provide following benefits to you
- No need for factory manager input to issue a token to the user
- Flexible pricing and conditions: can utilize other factories as a condition and can interact with [user groups contract](../../../blockchain/contracts/user-group-contract/index.md)
- Configurable accessibility time window which does not require you to manually disable ability to purchase Uniqs

## Purchase option use cases

There are various use cases that are covered by the first-hand purchase feature. The list below covers the most common ones that are supported:
- Specifying fixed UOS or USD price to purchase from factory
    - To have both prices available simultaneously, you can simply create two purchase options
- Restricting the number of Uniqs that can be bought from the specific purchase option
    - To globally limit the number that can be purchased (minted in this case) you have to specify it during the token factory creation
- Splitting the purchase revenue between multiple recipients
    - Note that protocol fee still applies and the split only occurs for UOS or USD amounts
- Limiting the availability window when Uniqs can be purchased
    - You can set a campaign to open at a later date and have a fixed date when it will end (or no end date at all)
- Specifying the price using Uniqs from other factories
    - Allows user to exchange or swap Uniqs
- Verify eligibility using Uniqs from other factories or user groups
    - Those are read-only operations, so user does not lose Uniqs or membership of the user group
- Migrating Uniqs of the factory to a new one which has desired alternative values set
    - Since some of the values inside the factory cannot be changed after creation that can be an alternative solution to effectively provide the option to users to migrate to a new factory with alternative values

### First-hand purchase directly from Uniq factory

All use cases above are accessible using the `setprchsreq.b` action and examples are provided in the following page: [factory purchase option examples](./factory-purchase-options-examples.md)

### Swap Uniqs

In certain situations you may need a more granular condition set which is not provided by the first-hand purchase feature. Since the range of possible conditions you may desire is vast we only limited the feature to the most common ones. For any more advanced usage you should consider utilizing a smart contract instead.

The example of a swap that uses `setprchsreq.b` action is provided [here](./factory-purchase-options-examples.md#using-purchase-option-for-swapping)

Refer to [this page](./exchange-a-uniq-using-smart-contract.md) for more in-depth explanation of the smart contract usage.

# How to add a first-hand purchase options using Ultra Tool Kit

Besides directly minting Uniqs or assigning authorized minters, it may be desired to allow users to directly purchase Uniqs from your factory. This can be achieved using the first-hand purchase feature which will be covered in this guide.

## Prerequisites

-   Created a Uniq Factory. Follow the [Factory creation guide](../creating-uniq-factories/how-to-create-uniq-metadata.md) for details.
-   Your account must have sufficient UOS tokens for transactions and fees. If you don't have tokens, see [how to use Faucet](../../fundamentals/tutorial-obtain-token-and-purchase-ram.md) for Testnet or [how to buy UOS](../../guides/how-to-buy-uos.md) for Mainnet.
- A developer account on the Ultra Testnet or Mainnet and to be logged into the Ultra Tool Kit. If you don't have it, please follow our previous tutorial: [Tutorial - Log in to the Ultra Tool Kit](../../fundamentals/tutorial-login-to-toolkit.md).

## Goal

The goal of this guide is to demonstrate the the process of adding and removing direct purchase options for your Factory.

## How to add first-hand purchase to your factory

First-hand purchase is a feature of NFT contract that allows factory managers to add a purchase option so that users can directly mint Uniqs themselves while paying some UOS or USD fee, or by potentially burning or transferring Uniqs. You can also require user to own some specific Uniq in order to use the purchase option.

You can see the list of potential use cases of this feature on the dedicated [Factory Purchase Options](../factory-management/factory-purchase-options.md) page.

To create a simple purchase option first navigate to [Factory management actions](https://toolkit.ultra.io/factoryManagement) and search for `setprchsreq`.

![](./images/first-hand-purchase-search-setprchsreq.png)

After finding it, select `Set first-hand purchase requirement (eosio.nft.ft::setprchsreq.b)` action.

There are multiple fields, here we will provide a short breakdown for each of them. For more details, refer to [action documentation](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/setprchsreq.b.md).

- **Token factory ID** - The ID of the token factory you manage and want to modify. You must be a manager of that factory
- **Purchase option index** - A number that will let you identify the purchase option, in case there are multiple options per factory. It can be any positive number you want, we advise you to start from 0 and increase it by one for any new purchase option you add. Note that if you set the purchase requirement with an existing index then it will overwrite it.
- **Purchase price** - Required payment in UOS or USD (will be converted to UOS at the time of purchase) to be able to purchase a Uniq. It can also be set to 0 but only if the `Purchase option with Uniqs` is set.
- **Purchase limit** - Dictates the maximum number of Uniqs that can be bought using this option specifically. The limit is not shared between the options. If you need to have a total cap then you better manage it though the minting limit of the factory. Optional, can leave it empty.
- **Promoter basis point** - A share of UOS that a promoter will get at the time of purchase, specified in basis points. Must be at least 200 (which is equal to 2%).
- **Purchase option with Uniqs** - Allows you to specify the price for this purchase option using Uniqs from other factories or to require the buyer to own Uniqs from specific factories. This field is covered in more detail in the later example in this guide.
- **Sale shares** - Specifies the list of accounts who will get a share of UOS from the purchase done using this purchase option. The `Basis points` field determines how much the account will get, specified in basis points (1 point = 0.01%). Optional, can leave it empty.
- **Maximum UOS payment** - The maximum amount of UOS you are ok to pay to create the purchase option. The payment is only used to cover RAM costs and is predictable. Optional, can leave it empty.
- **Group restriction** - Allows you to specify user groups who are able or not able to use this purchase option. Refer to [action documentation](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/setprchsreq.b.md) for a deeper explanation on how to use the user group restriction. Optional, can leave it empty.
- **Purchase window start** - Makes it so the purchase option is only available starting at some point in time in the format of `2021-05-01T00:00:00`. Optional, can leave it empty.
- **Purchase window end** - Makes it so the purchase option is only available until some point in time in the format of `2021-05-01T00:00:00`. Optional, can leave it empty.
- **Memo** - Simple text message that can be used for various purposes. Does not affect the result of the transaction. Optional, can leave it empty.

![](./images/first-hand-purchase-simple-UOS-price.png)

Click on `Send 1 Action`, review the details, and confirm your transaction.

You can now navigate to [Factory explorer](https://toolkit.ultra.io/uniqFactory), enter your Factory ID. After scrolling down, you will see the newly added purchase option.

## How to buy a Uniq using a first-hand purchase option

To purchase a Uniq directly using the new purchase option navigate to [Factory management actions](https://toolkit.ultra.io/factoryManagement).

Search for `purchase` and select `Purchase Uniqs directly (eosio.nft.ft::purchase.a)`.

![](./images/first-hand-purchase-search-purchase.png)

Now you need to fill the action form. There are multiple fields that you need to fill and here we will provide a short breakdown for each one of them.

- **Token factory ID** - The ID of the factory from which you want to purchase a Uniq.
- **Index** - Purchase option index that was specified in `setprchsreq.b` action.
- **Maximum UOS payment** - Maximum amount of UOS that you are willing to use for this purchase. It must be at least equal to the current price of the purchase option converted to UOS (in case it is originally specified in USD). You can put a larger value here but you will not be charged more than the current price at the time the transaction is executed. If the price of the purchase option is already in UOS then you can use the same value here.
- **Buyer** - The account that signs a transaction and who will pay the required amount of UOS and, if required, the Uniqs needed for this purchase option.
- **Receiver** - The account that will get the Uniq after the purchase is done. It can be the same as the `Buyer` in most cases.
- **Promoter** - The account that will get a share of UOS from this purchase. If you are building a marketplace you would want to specify your account as a promoter to receive a share of UOS from each purchase. If not specified then Ultra will be used as a promoter.
- **Provided Uniqs** - The list of Uniqs that you want to check, burn, or transfer. This is required if the purchase option specifies `Purchase option with Uniqs`. The example on how to fill this field will be provided later in this guide.
- **Memo** - Simple text message that can be used for various purposes. Does not affect the result of the transaction. Optional, can leave it empty.

For more details see the [action documentation](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/purchase.a.md).

![](./images/first-hand-purchase-purchase-simple-UOS-price.png)

After you have filled the form, click on `Send 1 Action`, review the details, and confirm the transaction.

Now you should be able to navigate to your inventory (either click on the `Inventory` on the home page of the Tool Kit https://toolkit.ultra.io/ or go to https://toolkit.ultra.io/user and enter desired account name manually).

You should be able to scroll down and see the list of Uniqs the account has. Note that it may take a minute for Ultra API to update and show your Uniq.

![](./images/first-hand-purchase-Uniq-in-inventory.png)

## How to set first-hand purchase requirement with a price in Uniqs

We will now cover the usage of `Purchase option with Uniqs` when creating a purchase option. This option allows you to require a payment to be done using Uniqs from other factories or to simply require a user to own a Uniq from a specific factory.

First, navigate to [Factory management actions](https://toolkit.ultra.io/factoryManagement), search again for `setprchsreq`, and select the `Set first-hand purchase requirement (eosio.nft.ft::setprchsreq.b)` action.

To specify the price in Uniqs you use the `Purchase option with Uniqs` field. You can add multiple entries to this field, each field corresponds to a single factory. Here is a breakdown for each of the fields:

- **Transfer tokens receiver account** - The account that will receive the Uniqs from the factories that use the strategy of 2 (transfer). This field is mandatory to specify if any of the factories use the strategy of 2 (transfer).
- **Required factories** - The list of factories required for this purchase option. Each one of them has the following fields:
    - **Token factory ID** - The ID of the factory that is required for this purchase option.
    - **Count** - How many Uniqs are required from the specified factory. Note that there is no way to specify any properties of the required Uniq, as long as it is from required factory it will work.
    - **Strategy** - There are 3 ways you can require Uniqs within your purchase option:
        - Check if account owns a Uniq from a specific factory (strategy 0)
        - Burn required Uniqs (strategy 1)
        - Transfer a Uniq from the owner to the account specified in `Transfer tokens receiver account` (strategy 2)

For more details see the [action documentation](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/setprchsreq.b.md).

In the following example we will configure a purchase option to burn a single Uniq in order to mint another one. This effectively swaps user's Uniq from one to another. The price will be set to 0 UOS so the only requirement is to have a Uniq from the specified factory.

This effectively achieves a swap mechanism where you "swap" one Uniq which you have for another one from the same or different factory and, potentially, a different metadata.

If you want to try and do the same you need to have a second factory or use the same one you already have. Note that if you reuse the same factory which does not have variants then it is effectively a useless operation as you will get a Uniq identical to the one you have burned.

![](./images/first-hand-purchase-price-in-Uniqs.png)

After filling out the form, click on `Send 1 Action`, review the details, and confirm the transaction.

You can now navigate to [Factory explorer](https://toolkit.ultra.io/uniqFactory), enter your Factory ID, and scroll down to see the new purchase option created.

![](./images/first-hand-purchase-price-in-Uniqs-result.png)

## How to buy a Uniq using a first-hand purchase option with price in Uniqs

The process of purchasing Uniq using the purchase option with Uniqs requirement is similar, but requires you to fill the `Provided Uniqs field`.

To do so, first navigate to [Factory management actions](https://toolkit.ultra.io/factoryManagement), and search again for `purchase` and select `Purchase Uniqs directly (eosio.nft.ft::purchase.a)`.

If the purchase option requires Uniqs from other factories then the account must have those Uniqs in its inventory. If you need to mint this Uniq then either refer to a [How to mint a Uniq using the Ultra Tool Kit](../creating-uniq-factories/how-to-mint-uniq-using-toolkit.md) guide or add add a simple first-hand purchase option with UOS price to this factory and purchase it, as was described in this guide.

Here we minted a Uniq from factory 4030, which was specified in the previous step as a requirement for the purchase option with index 1.

![](./images/first-hand-purchase-required-Uniq-to-burn.png)

Once you have the Uniq from the factory you specified in the purchase requirement, you will need to fill the `Provided user Uniqs` field.

- **Uniqs** - The list of Uniqs you provide to satisfy the purchase requirement. Note that the number of Uniqs should match the sum of all counts specified in purchase requirement. Providing more Uniqs will result in error.
    - **Uniq ID** - The ID of the Uniq you provide. It must be a Uniq the `Buyer` account owns.
    - **Strategy** - Determines what will happen to the Uniq and it must be identical to the one specified in the purchase requirement. This ensures the fact that you agree that this Uniq will be checked, burned, or transferred.

In this example we only need to provide a single Uniq and specify the strategy 1 (burn).

![](./images/first-hand-purchase-purchase-with-burn.png)

After clicking on `Send 1 Action`, reviewing the details, and confirming the transaction, you should be able to see your new Uniq in your [inventory](https://toolkit.ultra.io/user), as expected.

![](./images/first-hand-purchase-Uniq-purchased-after-burn.png)

## How to delete a first-hand purchase option

If the purchase option you created is no longer needed, you can decide to remove it and get a UOS refund for the RAM payment made during the option creation.

To delete a purchase option, navigate to [Factory management actions](https://toolkit.ultra.io/factoryManagement), and search again for `delprchsreq.a` and select `Delete first-hand purchase requirement (eosio.nft.ft::delprchsreq.a)`.

![](./images/first-hand-purchase-delete-search.png)

There are only a couple of fields you need to fill. For more details, refer to [action documentation](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/delprchsreq.a.md).

- **Token factory ID** - The ID of the Uniq factory where the purchase option was first added.
- **Purchase option index** - The index of the existing purchase option.
- **Memo** - Simple text message that can be used for various purposes. Does not affect the result of the transaction. Optional, can leave it empty.

![](./images/first-hand-purchase-delete-form.png)

Click on `Send 1 Action`, review the details, and confirm your transaction.

You can now navigate to [Factory explorer](https://toolkit.ultra.io/uniqFactory), enter your Factory ID. After scrolling down, you will see that the option has been deleted. In this example we have deleted the purchase option with index 1.

# How to perform advanced actions with Uniqs and Factories

After you have successfully created a factory and minted some Uniqs, you may now want to check what else you can do potentially.

This guide will cover some advanced actions that apply to Uniqs and Factories using the Ultra Tool Kit.

## Prerequisites

-   Created a Uniq Factory and minted some Uniqs. Follow the [Factory creation guide](../creating-uniq-factories/how-to-create-uniq-metadata.md) and the [Uniq minting guide](../creating-uniq-factories/how-to-mint-uniq-using-toolkit.md) for details.
-   Your account must have sufficient UOS tokens for transactions and fees. If you don't have tokens, see [how to use Faucet](../../fundamentals/tutorial-obtain-token-and-purchase-ram.md) for Testnet or [how to buy UOS](../../guides/how-to-buy-uos.md) for Mainnet.
- A developer account on the Ultra Testnet or Mainnet and to be logged into the Ultra Tool Kit. If you don't have it, please follow our previous tutorial: [Tutorial - Log in to the Ultra Tool Kit](../../fundamentals/tutorial-login-to-toolkit.md).

## Goal

The goal of this guide is to demonstrate the usage of some of the actions you can perform with your Uniqs and Factories using Ultra Tool Kit. This includes the transferring and burning Uniqs; adding authorized minters to a factory.

## How to transfer a Uniq to another account

For testing it may be necessary to transfer Uniqs manually and in greater quantities. You can use the tool kit to quickly assemble a transfer transaction and run it. For more details see the [action documentation](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/transfer.md).

First, navigate to [Uniq management actions](https://toolkit.ultra.io/uniqManagement), search `transfer`, and select the `Transfer token (eosio.nft.ft::transfer)` action.

![](./images/transfer-Uniq-search-transfer.png)

You need to fill the following fields:

- **From** - The account that currently owns the Uniq, you have logged in with, and want to transfer the Uniq from.
- **To** - The receiver of the Uniq.
- **Token IDs** - A list of Uniqs that will be transferred, you can add multiple and send them all at once. To know the Uniq ID you can use the user [inventory page](https://toolkit.ultra.io/user).
- **Memo** - Simple text message that can be used for various purposes. Does not affect the result of the transaction. Optional, can leave it empty.

![](./images/transfer-Uniq-form.png)

After clicking on `Send 1 Action`, reviewing the details, and confirming the transaction, you should be able to see the Uniq on the receiver account [inventory](https://toolkit.ultra.io/user).

## How to burn a Uniq manually

Burn action allows you to delete a token and get a UOS refund based on the portion of UOS that was spent to mint it. This effectively lets you get rid of Uniqs that are no longer needed. For more details see the [action documentation](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/burn.md).

First, navigate to [Uniq management actions](https://toolkit.ultra.io/uniqManagement), search `burn`, and select the `Burn a token (eosio.nft.ft::burn)` action.

![](./images/burn-Uniq-search-burn.png)

You need to fill the following fields:

- **Owner** - The account that owns a Uniq and that you have logged in with.
- **Token IDs** - A list of Uniqs that will be burned. You can burn multiple Uniqs at a time.
- **Memo** - Simple text message that can be used for various purposes. Does not affect the result of the transaction. Optional, can leave it empty.

![](./images/burn-Uniq-form.png)

After clicking on `Send 1 Action`, reviewing the details, and confirming the transaction, you should no longer see the Uniq on the owner account [inventory](https://toolkit.ultra.io/user).

## How to add authorized minters to a factory

Sometimes it may be desired to allow accounts other than the factory manager to mint Uniqs from the factory. For this purpose the authorized minter feature is used. For more details see the [action documentation](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/authmint.b.md).

To do so, first navigate to [Factory management actions](https://toolkit.ultra.io/factoryManagement), and search again for `authmint` and select `Authorize minter (eosio.nft.ft::authmint.b)`.

![](./images/authorized-minter-search-authmint.png)

You need to fill the following fields:

- **Authorizer** - The account that manages the factory or was previously authorized using authorized minter action.
- **Authorized minter** - The account that will be authorized to mint Uniqs from the factory or to delegate the minting authorization to other accounts.
- **Token factory ID** - The ID of the factory that the authorized minter will be allowed to mint from.
- **Quantity** - The maximum number of Uniqs that authorized minter will be allowed to mint. Mandatory to specify even if the factory has no limit on the number of Uniqs that can be minted.
- **Maximum UOS payment** - The maximum amount of UOS you are ok to pay to assign the authorized minter. The payment is only used to cover RAM costs and is predictable. Optional, can leave it empty.
- **Memo** - Simple text message that can be used for various purposes. Does not affect the result of the transaction. Optional, can leave it empty.

![](./images/authorized-minter-form.png)

After clicking on `Send 1 Action`, reviewing the details, and confirming the transaction, the `Authorized minter` account will be allowed to mint the specific number of Uniqs from the factory.

To actually mint the Uniqs as authorized minter you need to utilize the `Authorizer` field of `issue` action. Navigate to [Factory management actions](https://toolkit.ultra.io/factoryManagement), and search for `issue` and select `Issue tokens (eosio.nft.ft::issue.b)`.

![](./images/authorized-minter-search-issue.png)

Similar to [How to mint a Uniq using the Ultra Tool Kit](../creating-uniq-factories/how-to-mint-uniq-using-toolkit.md) guide you need to fill `To`, `Token factory ID` and `Amount`. But now you also need to additionally specify the `Authorizer`. The `Authorizer` must be an authorized minter assigned using the authorized minter action.

![](./images/authorized-minter-issue-form.png)

After clicking on `Send 1 Action`, reviewing the details, and confirming the transaction, you should be able to see the Uniq in the receiver account [inventory](https://toolkit.ultra.io/user).

![](./images/authorized-minter-result.png)

# Uniq First-Hand Purchase Example Project

This page covers an example project that lets users buy, swap or exchange their Uniqs using first hand purchase functionality. For installation instructions refer to the repository itself.

Code is available here: https://github.com/ultraio/example-first-hand-purchase

## Use cases

- This project provides a reference implementation for integrating first hand purchase functionality into your web-based solution.

- Parts of the implementation can be extracted and reused as needed or you can simply update the code to your needs and deploy it as is.

- If your project requires users to be able to get Uniqs in any way without having a backend then this example project can benefit you as it operates as a static website and interacts with Ultra Blockchain directly.

- Since some of the settings of Uniq factories are fixed during creation and cannot be changed you could utilize first-hand purchase functionality to let users exchange their Uniqs from existing factory to a new factory. This new factory could have different values for immutable settings (such as transferability window or tradeability window) and by exchanging a Uniq you will effectively change those values.

## How it works

Following steps are performed to get the user from the stage of loading the page up to a point of successfully getting a new Uniq:

- User is first prompted to connect the [Ultra Wallet Extension](../../../products/ultra-wallet/index.md). This is used to figure out the user's blockchain account name and what network he is connected to. Most users will be using the Mainnet but for testing and validation purposes Testnet may be used. This is already supported so no need to do any extra steps besides selecting the correct environment in the wallet extension

- Factory ID must be provided next to specify which factory should be utilized to get purchase options from. As there potentially could be a high number of factories with purchase options available this filtering step is necessary for smooth operation. Additionally it is an unlikely scenario that you don't know which factories you are integrating with. In case it is not true you can adjust the code so it scans all the possible purchase option entries

- User inventory is scanned to figure out which Uniqs user already has and which can be used for any first-hand purchase as a form of payment or proof of ownership

- Then user is presented with only the purchase options that he has Uniqs available for (and options which require Uniqs as a form of payment or a proof to begin with). The additional UOS/USD price will be listed as well for user awareness.

- After user selects a first hand purchase option he will need to specify which Uniqs should be used as a payment or a proof of ownership. Uniqs used for `burn` or `transfer` will be take from user inventory later on when transaction is executed

- The final step is for user to sign a transaction. In case something goes wrong a pop up will be created stating a reason for a failure in a short form. This behavior and messaging can be updated based on your needs.

## How to integrate or modify

With this example project you have primarily two options:

1. Modify the project directly
    - In this case you don't need any extra steps besides just introducing the changes you are interested in
    - The changes you may want to add include: styling changes, updating logic for filtering of purchase options, adding custom logic or actions into assembled transaction to integrate with any other smart contract
2. Take out the necessary parts out of the implementation or use it as a reference
    - In case you believe the project does too much for what you need then you can analyze the code and take only parts of the implementation

## How to deploy

In case you decide to go with modifying the example project instead of integrating parts of it you can use the provided GitHub workflow within the repository as a reference. Workflow runs the build step which will generate the HTML files and associated JavaScript source code after which it can be deployed to any hosting solution of your choice including GitHub Pages.

Since this example project works as a static website with no backend you should have no problem hosting, operating or distributing it.

# Uniq Factories

A uniq factory also known as a token factory is our non-fungible token system that is built on top of Ultra's blockchain.

## Uniqs

A Uniq is a unique digital asset representing ownership or authenticity proof using blockchain. Stored on a decentralized ledger, each uniq has a verifiable and tamper-proof transaction history, ensuring transparency. Uniqs can represent digital or physical items, and their ownership is facilitated through smart contracts, enabling secure and automated transactions.

# Uniq Auction

## Overview of Uniq Auction feature

Uniq Auction allows a Uniq owner to sell his Uniq to another user, similar to `resell`. Potential buyers place progressively increasing bids until the expiry date of the auction. The highest bidder will receive the Uniq after the auction concludes, and his bid will be split between the seller, factory royalties, and the promoter.

The auction creator controls the starting price, start date of an auction and promoter share.

Only UOS pricing is supported for an auction. The starting price must respect the minimum resell price of the factory. The start and initial expiry date of an auction must respect the trading window of the factory.

When a bid is placed, it will be transferred to a secure account and locked there until the new bid arrives or the auction is concluded.

When the auction is concluded, the funds will be distributed accordingly to [2nd Hand Sale Policy](../../../blockchain/general/antelope-ultra/2nd-hand-sale.md)

Usage of the actions for creating, cancelling, bidding and settling an auction is provided below.

-   [createauct.a - Create an Uniq auction](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/createauct.a.md)

-   [bidauction.a - Bid on an Uniq auction](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/bidauction.a.md)

-   [settleauct.a - Settle an expired Uniq auction](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/settleauct.a.md)

-   [cancelauct.a - Cancel an Uniq auction without any bids](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/cancelauct.a.md)

And the below action sets the global configurations for Uniq auctions.

-   [stauctcfg.a - Set global Uniq auction configuration](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/stauctcfg.a.md)

## Benefits of Uniq Auction

- Simpler price decision process: you specify the starting price, and at the end of the auction, you will receive the highest amount of UOS somebody was willing to pay for your Uniq.

- Auctions have a trackable start and end time: you can control when the auction for your Uniq will start and check the expiry time when desired. Note that the expiry time is extended if there are active bids going on.

- By locking the funds, we will protect Uniq owners from fake bidding and encourage buyers to use their funds smartly.

# Introducing Uniq Avatars

The Ultra Avatar contract, `ultra.avatar` allows users to set an Uniq as their avatar.

The user sets an avatar using the `setavatar` action and it is then availabe for anyone using Ultra's blockchain to view and use. They read data from the contract and render the Uniq inside their app.

Users can change their avatar with the same action or remove avatar completely with the `clearavatar` action.

If a user loses possession of the Uniq through transfer or burn actions, it can no longer be used as an avatar and an active avatar with such a Uniq will be cleared.

Users can set username with `updatename` action, user can only use alphabet, numerical with `.`, `_` and with at least 3 characters and can nor have more than 24 characters.

Also, user can link their ETH address to Ultra account with `addethaddr` action, the ETH address provide must be valid. When not in use, user can unlink it with `rmethaddr`.

## What are Uniq Avatars for?

We intend for Uniq Avatars to be used within Ultra as cross-ecosystem visual identifiers of users and their identity. This means that if you see someone with a Uniq as their avatar in a game or an application, you can rest assured that **it is verifiable**.

## Developer Use

For developers we provide details about the two actions available via the on-chain ABI.

-   [setavatar - Set user avatar](../../../blockchain/contracts/avatar-contract/avatar-actions/setavatar.md)
-   [clearavatar - Clear User avatar](../../../blockchain/contracts/avatar-contract/avatar-actions/clearavatar.md)
-   [updatename - Update username](../../../blockchain/contracts/avatar-contract/avatar-actions/updatename.md)
-   [addethaddr - Link ETH address to user](../../../blockchain/contracts/avatar-contract/avatar-actions/addethaddr.md)
-   [rmethaddr - Unlink ETH address from user](../../../blockchain/contracts/avatar-contract/avatar-actions/rmethaddr.md)

# Uniq Offer

## Overview of Uniq Offer feature

Uniq Offer allows a user to make an offer directly to the owner of Uniq or Uniq Factory if it's tradable.

Once these offers are made, the owner of Uniq can accept these offers as long as they are valid. This means offers remain valid even if the Uniq changes hands, ensuring your offer stands until it expires or is withdrawn.

Upon making an offer, the offered price is securely locked through smart contracts, safeguarding Uniq owners against fake bids.

You can cancel your offer anytime or let it expire. Once an offer expires, anyone can cancel the offer. When an offer is canceled, the offered price will be transferred back to the user who made the offer.

When an offer is accepted, the Uniq will be transferred to the specified buyer (or receiver if specified when making an offer), ensuring a smooth transition of ownership. The fund will also be released and transferred to the owner of the Uniq. If the promoter option is configured, fund will be distributed accordingly to [2nd Hand Sale Policy](../../../blockchain/general/antelope-ultra/2nd-hand-sale.md)

Usage of the actions for creating, accepting and canceling offers is provided below.

-   [mknftofr.a - Make an offer on a Uniq](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/mknftofr.a.md)
-   [acptnftofr.a - Accept a Uniq offer](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/acptnftofr.a.md)
-   [rmnftofr.a - Cancel a Uniq offer](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/rmnftofr.a.md)
-   [mkfctofr.a - Make an offer on a Uniq factory](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/mkfctofr.a.md)
-   [acptfctofr.a - Accept a Uniq factory offer](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/acptfctofr.a.md)
-   [rmfctofr.a - Cancel a Uniq factory offer](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/rmfctofr.a.md)

And the below action sets the global configurations for Uniq offer.

-   [stofrcfg.a - Set global Uniq offer configuration](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/stofrcfg.a.md)

## Benefits of Uniq Offer

- Even if a user misses a Uniq sale, as long as the Uniq is tradable, the user can make an offer to buy it directly from its current owner.

- By locking the funds, we will protect Uniq owners from fake bidding and encourage buyers to use their funds smartly.

- An offer will always be valid until it's expired or cancelled. In this way, the new owner can always resell right away if they don't like or there's a better offer missed by the last owner.

# Uniq On-chain Data

## Overview of Uniq On-chain Data feature

Uniq On-chain Data allows the factory manager to add key pair values in their settings to allow any Uniq minted from that factory to modify their data. When defined in factory keys settings, an authorized user can alter any key values, and values will be stored only on Uniq.

The factory manager has to pay a non-refundable RAM fee when adding the new key pair.

Whenever a Uniq is minted from that factory, a RAM fee will be transferred from the manager to his key RAM vault and will be refunded to the manager when Uniq is burnt.

Usage of the actions for adding new key pair for factory and updating value in Uniq are provided below.

-   [addkeys.a - Add new key pair for factory](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/addkeys.a.md)

-   [setvals.a - Set key value for Uniq](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/setvals.a.md)

And the below action sets the global supported key type for Uniq on-chain data.

-   [setktypes - Set supported key types for key pair](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/stauctcfg.a.md)

## Benefits of Uniq On-chain data

- Allow Uniq's metadata to be updated on chain.

- Changing off-Chain metadata constantly with the backend is tedious and inefficient in many scenarios.

- Having on-chain Uniq data would also allow Uniq marketplaces to provide filters for Uniqs whose data are changing regularly.

title: 'Example Metadata Project'

---


# Example Project with Reveal

Let's create a minimalistic bored ape factory. It has to contain 3 metadata files and 3 jsons
for factory, default token and uniq. For the sake of simplicity, we'll only fill the required fields for each metadata file. You can of course enrich uniqs, for example, by adding `attributes` to them. See [uniq metadata fields](../uniq-metadata.md#metadata-fields).

Since this is a reveal scenario each uniq will be displayed as a question mark until it's minted. This is controlled by `default_token_uri` which acts as fallback in case there's no uri for a token.

Download the example project [here](https://github.com/ultraio/docs-example-x/blob/main/nft/example-pfp-project.zip?raw=true).

## Minting a token

Whenever there's a mint action triggered on your backend you can dynamically fill a token's uri:

```sh
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft issue.b '[
  {
    "to": "to.user.acc",
    "token_configs": [
      {
        "token_factory_id": 256,
        "amount": 1,
        "custom_data": ""
      }
    ],
    "token_metadata": [
      {
        "meta_uri": "https://s3.us-east-1.wasabisys.com/ultraio-uniq-dev/example-pfp-project/uniq.json",
        "meta_hash": "741f4cd605d0c777e42399367b10ffac621e8652bf709ed6ada2dd06d570f144"
      }
    ],
    "memo": ""
  }
]' -p ultra.nft.ft
```

# Uniq variants - On issue.b smart contract example

This page describes an example smart contract that utilizes smart contract notifications produced by `eosio.nft.ft` contract when one of the actions within it are utilized. As a goal for this smart contract we chose to modify the token URI right after it is minted based on it's serial number. For tokens with even or odd serial number we will substitute one of 2 possible URIs.

### Logic

When writing a smart contract that actively interacts with some other contract you need to either write some definitions to properly read the data from that other smart contract or you will need to get the definitions directly from the smart contract source code. This is needed since data on blockchain is stored in dense binary representation so without these definitions you will only be able to get the raw binary data from the smart contract which is not convenient to work with.

For this smart contract to properly interact with `eosio.nft.ft` we will need information regarding the following tables:

- `token.b` - described using `token_v1` structure. This table stores information about all tokens of NFT standard v1
- `next.token` - described using `next_token_number` structure. This singleton stores the id of the next token that will be minted, by subtracting 1 you get the id of the token that was previously minted.

To know the layout of those tables refer to the following documents [uniq metadata fields](../../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-tables.md)

In addition to the above we also need to define an action within our smart contract with interface that matches `issue.b` action. This will cause `eosio.nft.ft` contract to notify us when `issue.b` action is executed and the account that will host this contract (here it will be `onissue`) is involved in the minting process (e.g. `onissue` is the issuer of the token). For that the following interface is re-created with an indication to listen for `issue.b` action:

```cpp
[[eosio::on_notify("eosio.nft.ft::issue.b")]]
void on_issue(const issue_wrap_v1& issue);
```

We will also add 2 extra actions to be able to configure which URI will be used depending on if serial number is odd or even. This data will be stored a simple singleton `uricfg` and depending on the scope it will be either for even URIs (scope is 0) or for odd URIs (scope is 1). The actions themselves are `even_uri` and `odd_uri` and they simply write input string into the singleton.

Logic for `on_issue` listener is to first deduce the token ID that was just minted by reading `next.token` singleton, then to read the `token.b` to get the serial number of the token. After that we simply read `uricfg` singleton and get the URI to write based on the serial number of the token and do an inline call to `settknmeta`. The `settknmeta` action will be responsible for writing the new URI we want into the token data since our example contract does not have authority to change data of other smart contracts - we can only read the data and do inline action calls.

::: info
To be able to do the inline call to `settknmeta` an extra permission is required for `onissue` account. It is configured in the test using the following `cleos` command:
```
await cleos(`set account permission onissue active --add-code onissue -p onissue@owner`)
```
This is equivalent to adding `onissue@eosio.code` account permission inside `onissue@active`. And effectively means that smart contract stored in `onissue` account has same authority that `onissue@active` would have
:::

### Disclaimers

::: warning
This example contract is not production ready and has some functionality and checks missing, be sure to do a proper testing if you intend to use any of the code provided in your solution
:::

::: warning
This contract only listens to `issue.b` action, but tokens may also be issued when `issue` action is called after v1 actions are enabled. That means that in addition to listening to `issue.b` action you may also want to listen to `issue` action. This is only applicable in cases where you don't control the service that initiates the minting process (e.g. token is issued from 3rd party to your service). This example contract assumes you have full control over the minting process so only `issue.b` action is considered
:::

::: warning
`issue.b` action supports minting multiple tokens at a time but this example contract will only update the very last token minted per `issue.b` action. This again assumes you have full ownership of the minting process and can control the number of tokens minted at a time. If this is not the case the smart contract will require adjustments to support multiple tokens minted at a time.
:::

::: warning
This contract assumes no one will be issuing tokens to `onissue` contract so if someone actually does try to issue a token this example contract will try to modify it, but will fail since it will most likely not be the factory manager.
:::

### How to build and test

First step after writing the `onissue.hpp` and `onissue.cpp` will be to build the contract. Follow [this](../../../../tutorials/smart-contracts/compile.md) for instructions of the build process.

As an alternative the build command using `cdt-cpp`:

```bash
cdt-cpp ./src/onissue.cpp -abigen
```

After you successfully compile the contract you will have two files: `onissue.abi` and `onissue.wasm` both of them are needed for proper functionality of your contract on-chain.

The test provided in `onissue.ultra_test.js` in the section below assumes that the compiled contract is located at `pconfig.ultraRootPath + '/eosio.contracts/build/contracts/onissue'` where `ultraRootPath` is the persistent path configured for `ultratest` (e.g. the end result could be `~/ultra/eosio.contracts/build/contracts/onissue`). In your case it may not be true so be sure to modify the `set contract` section of the test with correct path to your contract.

To run the test simply run the `ultratest` with proper path to the test file:

```bash
ultratest -t ./onissue.ultra_test.js
```

title: 'Variant Example Use Cases'

---

# Variant example use cases

Variant standard is quite flexible and allows for a variety of potential projects and use cases. This page will cover some of them and explain how they work

## Video game token factory

The simplest example is providing the same metadata to all the tokens minted from the factory. Such example could be tokens of a specific game, where each token is identical. This factory utilizes `default_token_uri` to avoid duplication inside each minted token

| Property                   | Value                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| factory.default_token_uri  | MyGame.com/Metadata        |
| factory.default_token_hash | b0dafd687d5527cef28300392e |
| token.uri (per token)      | _null_                     |
| token.hash (per token)     | _null_                     |

## Video game token factory with a rare unique copy

Similar to the previous example we have a simple factory for game tokens where all of them are identical except for a few unique cases. For those unique tokens (here it is token #1000000) we provide a specific URI and hash so it does not fallback to default

| Property                   | Value                                         |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| factory.default_token_uri  | MyGame.com/DefaultMetadataMyGame.com/Metadata |
| factory.default_token_hash | b0dafd687d5527cef28300392e                    |
| token.uri (#1000000)       | MyGame.com/1MthMetadata                       |
| token.hash (#1000000)      | 4e3304e9af1ec7aaa05206b                       |
| token.uri (rest of Uniqs)  | _null_                                        |
| token.hash (rest of Uniqs) | _null_                                        |

## Simple profile picture project

Common situation for profile picture projects is that there is a base URI with serial number utilized as an identifier to find the metadata for a specific token. By using a dynamic value inside `default_token_uri` we can avoid duplication of base URI inside each of the minted tokens and can still provide a hash to each of the tokens for the purposes of data provenance.

| Property                   | Value                                     |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| factory.default_token_uri  | https://AngryBananas/Uniq/{serial_number} |
| factory.default_token_hash | _null_                                    |
| token.uri (#1)             | _null_                                    |
| token.hash (#1)            | bea34b0a7cdef454f4                        |
| ...                        | ...                                       |
| token.uri (#1000)          | _null_                                    |
| token.hash (#1000)         | def454f46557a96ff84                       |

## Obfuscated profile picture project

In some cases it may be desired for a profile picture project to not be able to probe metadata beforehand by substituting different serial numbers. Since serial numbers are sequential it is easy to go through all of them. In this example we use token hash which is not known beforehand as a part of dynamic `deafult_token_uri`. Hash of the token will only be known after the token is minted.

| Property                   | Value                            |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| factory.default_token_uri  | https://AngryBananas/Uniq/{hash} |
| factory.default_token_hash | _null_                           |
| token.uri (#1)             | _null_                           |
| token.hash (#1)            | bea34b0a7cdef454f4               |

## IPFS-based profile picture project

Alternative storage solutions may have a different way of naming the metadata URIs. This example demonstrates how in case of IPFS you could provide both a URI and a hash for all the tokens you mint as each metadata file on IPFS will have a unique URI.

| Property                   | Value                                     |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| factory.default_token_uri  | https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qme7ss3ARVgxv6rX     |
| factory.default_token_hash | b0dafd687d5527cef28300392e                |
| token.uri (#1)             | https://ipfs.io/ipfs/04e9af1ec7aaa0520    |
| token.hash (#1)            | bea34b0a7cdef454f4                        |
| ...                        | ...                                       |
| token.uri (#1000)          | https://ipfs.io/ipfs/cdef454f46557a96ff84 |
| token.hash (#1000)         | def454f46557a96ff84                       |

# Common metadata concepts

## Integrity

Integrity allows standard integrators and Ultra backend to validate how genuine the provided information is. By providing a hash within the integrity field it is possible to verify that the associated data (e.g. media image or another JSON file) is what it is claimed to be by calculating it's hash and comparing it with the one provided within the metadata.

For now the only supported hash algorithm is SHA256 and hash must be represented as a hexidecimal string

The following schema is used for the integrity field

```JSON
"integrity": {
   "type": "object",
   "properties": {
      "type": { "type": "string", "enum": ["SHA256"] },
      "hash": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "only 64 characters SHA256 hash is supported initially",
            "minLength": 64,
            "maxLength": 64,
            "pattern": "^([a-fA-F0-9]{2})+$"
      }
   },
   "required": ["type", "hash"],
   "additionalProperties": false
}
```

## Static resource

Static resource describes some piece of data that is intended to change infrequently or never at all. For static resource you specify it's `contentType`, provide a single URI pointing to the resource and provide an `integrity` field (described above). Each time any change is done to the underlying data described by the static resource you must update the associated `integrity` field to maintain data consistency. Note that this may require you to also update the hash in any parent metadata files containing the resource fields and it will also require you to update token/factory metadata hash on-chain.

The following schema is used for the static resource field

```JSON
"staticResource": {
   "type": "object",
   "description": "A static resource provides a hash to check integrity",
   "properties": {
         "contentType": { "type": "string" },
         "uris": {
            "type": "array",
            "minItems": 1,
            "items": { "type": "string" }
         },
         "integrity": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
               "type": { "type": "string", "enum": ["SHA256"] },
               "hash": {
                     "type": "string",
                     "description": "only 64 characters SHA256 hash is supported initially",
                     "minLength": 64,
                     "maxLength": 64,
                     "pattern": "^([a-fA-F0-9]{2})+$"
               }
            },
            "required": ["type", "hash"],
            "additionalProperties": false
         }
   },
   "required": ["contentType", "uris", "integrity"],
   "additionalProperties": false
}
```

## Dynamic resource

Dynamic resource describes some piece of data that is intended to change frequently or you are is not intended to have any integrity or validation attached to it. For dynamic resource you specify it's `contentType` and provide a single URI pointing to the resource. No integrity field is specified in this case and there is no need to update any other place in the metadata file in case underlying data pointed by dynamic resource is changed.

The following schema is used for the dynamic resource field

```JSON
"dynamicResource": {
   "type": "object",
   "title": "DynamicResource",
   "description": "A dynamic resource can be refreshed to discover changes",
   "properties": {
         "contentType": { "type": "string" },
         "uris": {
            "type": "array",
            "minItems": 1,
            "items": { "type": "string" }
         }
   },
   "required": ["contentType", "uris"],
   "additionalProperties": false
}
```

## Metadata media

Each token and factory must have some visual representation added to it so it could be nicely displayed in the frontend. Each media must be represented as a [staticResource](#static-resource) with a hash specified.

Breakdown of each individual media:

| Field   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| product | This is a main media resource visually representing your token. If your token is a picture of an apple then `product` media would be this picture by itself                                                                         |
| square  | Square image is used whenever multiple tokens are shown on the same page, by providing a square image you make it easy to display your token by making it's representation tileable.                                                |
| hero    | Hero image is a big banner image that is typically placed in the top middle of the page. You can think of it as a movie poster buy applied to Uniq token.                                                                           |
| gallery | Here you provide a list of multiple media files. Not always would it make sense to have multiple images, but if this token is representing an in-game item then gallery images could be screenshots of this item in the game itself |


```JSON
"media": {
   "description": "Specify the advertising content for this NFT Factory",
   "type": "object",
   "properties": {
         "product": { "$ref": "#/definitions/staticResource" },
         "square": { "$ref": "#/definitions/staticResource" },
         "hero": { "$ref": "#/definitions/staticResource" },
         "gallery": {
            "description": "A list of path pointing to images, videos... relative from this manifest relative from this manifest.",
            "type": "array",
            "items": { "$ref": "#/definitions/staticResource" }
         }
   },
   "required": ["product", "square"],
   "additionalProperties": false
}

# Factory metadata

## Introduction

Factory metadata represents the high level overview of the Uniqs that this factory could mint. This metadata should always exist when a token factory is created and should contain the necessary information about what this factory is and what kind of tokens are expected to be minted from it. By specifying distinguishable name, description and media images you provide the necessary feedback for the users to know what to expect from tokens minted from this factory. Example of the theme for a factory could be a collection of images and in this case factory metadata would describe what kind of images to expect from this factory and what there common concept is or you could provide a breakdown about the rarity of some of images to expect (e.g. there are some more rare and special images compared to the rest)

## Concepts

Refer to this page for explanation on some concepts used in the metadata files

> [Common metadata concepts](./common-metadata-concepts.md)

## Metadata fields

Here is a short breakdown of possible fields for factory metadata and their purpose. In the next section a more detailed information will be provided for some of the fields. For exact restrictions per field see JSON schema at the bottom of the document

| Property Name | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| attributes    | This field allows you to specify structured numerical or string data for the factory. Each attribute must be represented as an object with a `name` - title of the attribute; `description` - details about what this attribute is; `type` - either `boolean`, `number`, `string` or `ISODateString`; `dynamic` - true or false depending on if it is intended to change over time or not, in any case it will be a part of the hash calculation |
| resources     | Allows additional media or reference data to be added as a part of the metadata. Each resource must be described as a `staticResource` (details here [staticResource](./common-metadata-concepts.md#static-resource))                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

The following fields are required to be specified:
- `specVersion`
- `name`
- `defaultLocale`
- `media`
  - `product`
    - `contentType`
    - `uris`
    - `integrity`
      - `type`
      - `hash`
  - `square`
    - `contentType`
    - `uris`
    - `integrity`
      - `type`
      - `hash`

## Minimalistic example

To get started here is a simplest example of the valid factory metadata you can provide

```JSON
{
    "specVersion":"1.0",
    "name":"Uniq factory",
    "defaultLocale":"en-US",
    "media": {
        "product": {
            "contentType":"image/png",
            "integrity": {
                "type":"SHA256","hash":"76378a8e97f500dfd69fb9816189fb503a913e0f306a4307bc2d4d61ded8f89e"
            },
            "uris":["https://example.io/uniq/76378a8e97f500dfd69fb9816189fb503a913e0f306a4307bc2d4d61ded8f89e.png"]
        },
        "square": {
            "contentType":"image/png",
            "integrity":{
                "type":"SHA256","hash":"f41938bf16ed3e779b3de6c63e531bce84101947da49617ee6f6322ecadb1b0e"
            },
            "uris":["https://example.io/uniq/f41938bf16ed3e779b3de6c63e531bce84101947da49617ee6f6322ecadb1b0e.png"]
        }
    }
}
```

## JSON schema

Here the JSON schema is provided for Uniq factory metadata which can be used for validation purposes using AJV. Additionally it gives insight about what the allowed values are for different fields

```JSON

    "type": "object",
    "description": "The NTF Factory metadata",
    "properties": {
        "specVersion": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The version of the NFT Factory metadata standard specification which the manifest uses. This enables the interpretation of the context. Compliant manifests MUST use a value of 0.1 when referring to this version of the specification."
        },
        "name": {
            "type": "string",
            "minLength": 1,

# FAQ

## Whats the difference between asset creator and asset manager roles inside token factory?

Asset creator is an entity responsible for the fact of token factory creation. Being an asset creator implies that due to your initiative this token factory is created.

On the other hand asset manager is the one responsible for any changes done to the factory itself. Asset manager regulates all factory settings and performs minting of tokens. His signature is also required to create a token factory as a sign of cooperation between the creator and manager

Asset creator and manager can be (and often is) the same entity

## Why can't I provide a simple URI to the image for factory/token?

NFT standard developed by Ultra aims not only to extend the flexibility offered to the developers but also to provide a good user experience. As such in Ultra client for better visual feedback we are displaying different versions of the desired Uniq image that better fits the user interface and requires the developer to provide those different image variations as to not accidentally mess up your work with automated processing

In addition to that by requiring a metadata to be represented as a JSON with clearly defined standard version and layout we reduce ambiguity for all parties

## Why isn't metadata stored on-chain?

Depending on the use case the metadata files could be as large as a couple of megabytes. Since the RAM is a limited and expensive resource for the blockchain we want to minimize the impact of NFT standard on it. In addition to that even if metadata was to be stored on-chain that won't be sufficient for a complete solution as it will still refer to media files stored off-chain

## Why do I need to know token owner to find token metadata?

There could be many different use cases for associating a specific token with some other property (token id, token factory id, token owner, serial number, etc). We decided that the most common use case is to view a list of tokens owned by a specific user since any interaction with a specific token always goes through the owner of that token (e.g. to transfer or sell a token you need owner's approval).

If there is a need to bypass that requirement (e.g. showing a gallery of all tokens for a specific token factory) then you must rely on alternative solutions either through streaming or by querying the full metadata table and performing data manipulation locally

## Why some actions have .b (or similar) extension at the end and others don't? Why I can (or can't) use the action without .b extension instead?

Extensions such as `.b` indicate a next iteration of the specific action. This is done for actions that have a breaking change in the interface or in the data they are referencing (e.g. `issue.b` action will work with contract tables `token.b` and `factory.b` and only after it is activated).

Some actions that don't have this extension will redirect you to a new version automatically by converting provided arguments (e.g. `issue` action will trigger `issue.b`), but you are still advised to use an appropriate latest available action.

Some actions may not have a newer iteration available in case no changes are done to the interface or the logic is backwards compatible (e.g. `setstatus`)

## Can I hide metadata until I am ready to reveal it? How can I use a serial number of the token as a part of the metadata URI? How do I avoid micromanaging URI/hashes on-chain?

Refer to pages related to [organizing factory metadata](./organizing-metadata.md) and [example use cases](./Examples/variant-example-use-cases.md)

## Why can't I use my own RAM to store NFT data instead of paying a fee?

On Ultra blockchain the RAM price fluctuates based on the available supply meaning that for one developer the price to publish token factory and mint tokens will be different compared to another developer and will fluctuate over time.

To avoid this issue and make the process of creating a Uniq factory predictable in terms of cost we enforce a flat fee specified in USD and does not depend on any blockchain state. But note that the payment for RAM in this case is still done in UOS by using USD/UOS conversion rate.

## Why is X storage solution not supported?

Right now our Backend expects all external data to be accessible through simple HTTP/HTTPS endpoints. In case your storage solution relies on some other type of the protocol you are temporarily encouraged to use a proxy server that will serve the media through HTTP/HTTPS protocol

# Uniq Variants

This section aims to inform our users of how Uniq's and their individual variants currently work. It will help familiarize end users with our terminology, and how our Uniq data is structured.

## Terminology

These are generalized terms to help identify how the developers at Ultra speak about the NFTs that are minted.

* Uniq
  * NFT
  * A uniq is a single token that is generated by a Uniq Factory.
  * A uniq can have its own unique **uri** which points to metadata.

* Uniq Factory
  * A uniq factory is a system that mints tokens based on specific metadata.
  * Each factory on-chain has the following:
    *  factory_uri
    *  factory_hash
    *  default_token_uri
    *  default_token_hash
  * The values above are used to determine where metdata is located, and the hash is made from the contents of the metadata file.

* Metadata
  * Is a type of dataset that is stored off-chain and usually has different hashes to verify the authenticity of the data.
  * Inside you can usually find links to images, descriptions, and traits for a given token, or factory.

* Hash
  * A set of bytes that are strung together to generate a unique string based on those bytes of data.
  * In Ultra's case we use the SHA-256 algorithm for its wide availability across all platforms

* Uniq Default Token
  * Uniq's utilize a default token to apply a template to any token that does not have unique data.
  * The metadata from this file is automatically applied.

### Recap

This is the short version of the above.

* Uniq Factories create Uniq's that contain references to their uniq factory, or individual metadata.
* Metadata can be obtained by visiting the various URLs inside of a factory, or an individual token.
* All uniqs can have their own metadata, or utilize a single default template for all uniqs.
* The authenticity of data is verified by the SHA256 algorithm by hashing the contents of files, and the files inside of the files.

## Uniq Factory Metadata

Each Uniq Factory is required to utilize our schema's to help standardize the system across our entire platform.

In the link provided below, you can learn more about how this uniq factory metadata is built, and what to expect when building your own uniq factory.

> [Factory Metadata](./factory-metadata.md)

## Uniq Default Token Metadata

Depending on the factory strategy it may either supply a `default_token_uri` or individually link to a `uri` inside of the uniq itself. The uniq can be *revealed* at runtime by appending the `uri` that is necessary for a unqi to have its own metadata.

Factory managers may choose to lock a uniq's data after it is minted depending on how they would like to distribute their uniqs.

In the link provided below, you can learn more about the default token and its given format.

> [Uniq Default Metadata](./uniq-default-metadata.md)

## Uniqs

Uniqs have their own schema that is shared with the default token, but there are a few differences in how it functions. In the link provided below you can learn more about what actions to call, and individual changes that can be applied to a uniq.

> [Uniq Metadata](./uniq-metadata.md)

# Organizing metadata

This page will cover how the metadata off-chain can be linked to on-chain data and what options you have to better organize your metadata URIs

## Dynamic and static metadata URI

The distinction between static and dynamic metadata URI applies only for `default_token_uri` field inside the token factory. By specifying one of the possible dynamic values inside the `default_token_uri` the URI will automatically be considered as dynamic for the purposes of searching the token metadata as described in the section below.

If no dynamic value is used inside `default_token_uri` then this URI will be considered static.

Acceptable dynamic URI values:

-   `factory_id` - Factory ID based on the on-chain data
-   `serial_number` - Serial number of a specific token. Incremental value starting from 1
-   `id` - ID of the token. Pool of possible IDs is shared between all Uniqs and in general you won't know it until the token is minted
-   `hash` - Hash of the token metadata stored per token

Example of `static` default token URI: http://myfactory.io/deafult_token.json

Example of `dynamic` default token URI: http://myfactory.io/{serial_number}.json

## How to set factory metadata

Factory can contain two different types of metadata URI: factory metadata URI and default uniq metadata. Factory metadata URI must always be provided and point to a single JSON metadata file. Factory metadata hash must also be provided and be a hash of the metadata file pointed by factory metadata URI.

For default token URI there is a flexibility in choosing between static and dynamic default token URI (the difference is explained above) but you must always specify some default token URI. For static default token URI you have a possibility to also specify a hash, but for dynamic default token URI you should not be providing hash since dynamic URI implies the possibility that it points to multiple different metadata files depending on the context and thus a single hash cannot fully describe the provenance of metadata files.

The following diagram displays potential use cases when setting factory URIs:

![](/images/bbea7125-931a-4f98-b99e-d91ac8c8fe48.png)

Token factory metadata can be specified during creation - [create.b](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/create.b.md)

Following actions are used to change factory metadata URIs and hashes after creation:
[setmeta.b](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/setmeta.b.md)
[setdflttkn](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/setdflttkn.md)

## How to set token metadata

You have an option to provide a metadata URI and hash for each token individually. In this case there will be no need to fallback to default token URI inside the token factory.

Both the URI and hash are optional. You may want to provide either of them or both of them at the same time depending on your use case. Refer to this page for details: [use cases](./Examples/variant-example-use-cases.md)

Token metadata can be specified when minting a token - [issue.b](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/issue.b.md)

Alternatively URI and hash can be changed after the token is minted using the following action - [settknmeta](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/settknmeta.md)

## How to find metadata for a given Uniq

For the integrators it may be important to know how to fetch the token metadata if you already know the [on-chain token data](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-tables.md#token-b).

The first step is to check if there is a URI specified on the token itself by checking the `uri` field of the token. If it is specified then you are done - go to `uri` and fetch the metadata.

In case the `uri` is empty or points to an invalid file you need to fallback to default token URI stored inside the token factory. Token factory ID is available in the token data and by querying the `factory.b` table you will be able to access it's `default_token_uri` field.

Then depending on if `default_token_uri` is dynamic or not one of two following paths should be used:

-   `default_token_uri` is `static` - go to the URI pointed by `default_token_uri` and fetch the metadata
-   `default_token_uri` is `dynamic` - substitute all dynamic values inside the URI with information available in the token data (e.g. serial number) and then fetch the metadata using the generated URI.

Refer to the following diagram for details:

# Uniq default metadata

## Introduction

Uniq default metadata is utilized whenever any token is reference that does not have a dedicated metadata URI. This can happen either intentionally if the tokens minted from the factory are identical (so there is no need for anything except default metadata) or accidentally in case due to some issue the tokens are minted without a dedicated metadata URI. In any case the default metadata functions identically to individual Uniq metadata with only exceptions that it is utilized when there is no override and the URI for this metadata is placed in the dedicated field of the factory on-chain data `default_token_uri`.

## Supported dynamic values

Default token URI supports special `dynamic` values that can be used to modify the URI based on different context values which are different between different tokens/factories. If none of those values are specified the the URI is considered to be `static` (meaning that it is not context dependant). Followind `dynamic` values are supported:

| Value         | Description                                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| factory_id    | ID of the token factory from which the token was minted |
| id            | ID of the token                                         |
| hash          | Hash of the token                                       |
| serial_number | Serial number of the token                              |

To specify a `dynamic` values within a URI you must enclose it in `{}` like so: `https://example.io/{token_id}.json` which should evaluate to `https://example.io/42.json` for the token with serial number of 42 whenever Ultra or any other integrator will be reading this default token metadata.

# Uniq metadata

## Introduction

Uniq metadata represents what this specific token is - it's name, description and attached media and data. When the token is issued you can attach a URI of this Uniq metadata to the token and this way you would create a link between on-chain token and off-chain metadata. Example of what this metadata could represent can be an image from a collection of various other images and in this case you would put this image as one of the `media` fields and fill out the name and description to give some flavour to the token.

## Concepts

Refer to this page for explanation on some concepts used in the metadata files

# Updating uniqs

An important aspect of the Ultra NFT standard is metadata updates. Game publishers should be able to change uniq's traits based on certain events in their games. On the other hand integrators should be able to verify its authenticity. Let's see how it works with the examples below:

## Creating a factory & Issuing tokens

Let's [`create`](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/create.b.md) a factory first and [`issue`](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/issue.b.md) a token:
```sh
# Create
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft create.b '[
  {
    "memo": "",
    "asset_manager": "ultra.nft.ft",
    "asset_creator": "ultra",
    "minimum_resell_price": null,
    "resale_shares": [
      {
        "receiver": "ultra.nft.ft",
        "basis_point": 1
      }
    ],
    "mintable_window_start": "2021-05-31T00:00:00",
    "mintable_window_end": null,
    "trading_window_start": "2021-05-31T00:00:00",
    "trading_window_end": null,
    "recall_window_start": null,
    "recall_window_end": null,
    "max_mintable_tokens": 10000,
    "lockup_time": null,
    "conditionless_receivers": null,
    "stat": 0,
    "factory_uri": "ipfs://my_factory_uri",
    "factory_hash": "475970a4b0016368d0503d1ce01577376f91f5a5ba63dd4353683bd95101b88d",
    "authorized_minters": null,
    "account_minting_limit": 100,
    "transfer_window_start": null,
    "transfer_window_end": null,
    "maximum_uos_payment": null,
    "default_token_uri": "ipfs://my_default_token",
    "default_token_hash": "475970a4b0016368d0503d1ce01577376f91f5a5ba63dd4353683bd95101b88d",
    "lock_hash": null
  }
]' -p ultra.nft.ft -p ultra
# Issue
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft issue.b '[
  {
    "to": "ultra",
    "token_configs": [
      {
        "token_factory_id": 0,
        "amount": 1,
        "custom_data": ""
      }
    ],
    "memo": "",
    "authorizer": null,
    "maximum_uos_payment": null,
    "token_metadata": [
      {
        "meta_uri": "ipfs://uniq_uri",
        "meta_hash":"475970a4b0016368d0503d1ce01577376f91f5a5ba63dd4353683bd95101b88d"
      }
    ]
  }
]' -p ultra.nft.ft

```

After a factory and token is minted we can look up their ids from `factory.b` and `token.b` tables respectively. Let's say they're both `0` for the sake of this tutorial.

## Updating factory metadata

If a content creator reuploads a new factory metadata they have to use [`setmeta.b`](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/setmeta.b.md) to change the corresponding data:

```sh
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft setmeta.b '[
  0,
  "updating",
  "ipfs://new_factory_uri",
  "06528450506980cf5ab3a5cfeb870cb3109acd2fe6094c00d4e4ab31ac129b35"
]' -p ultra.nft.ft
```

## Updating a default token

Default token metadata is used as a fallback mechanism whenever there's no uri for a token. Here's how one updates on-chain data for it using [setdflttkn](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/setdflttkn.md) action:

```sh
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft setdflttkn '[
  0,
  "reuploading default token",
  "https://s3...",
  "fbbf2217571b6dbe2fca75b0fd3aebb5b4e247bc89e235d4d09d014bb855d1c9"
]' -p ultra.nft.ft
```

## Update a uniq

Updating uniq's is done with [`settknmeta`](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/settknmeta.md) action:

```sh
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft settknmeta '[
  0,
  "ultra",
  "update hash 2",
  "ipfs://uniq_uri",
  "cccf7bb05104ee6737d94a7f85b3cf4a9f44f67f2d198572c155721a07395613"
]' -p ultra.nft.ft@active
```

It's important to reiterate that whenever you make any changes to metadata (including images updates) for a token/factory you should also update corresponding data onchain, i.e uris/hashes. Otherwise, integrators won't be able to pick up the changes.

## Locking changes

For certain usecases it might make sense to make a factory immutable. Luckily there's a [`lckfactory`](../../../blockchain/contracts/nft-contract/nft-actions/lckfactory.md) action which enables a manager to disable any content updates. This might be useful for an nft art gallery as it allows the users to be sure theirupdating_metadata.md artwork will never change.

**THE CHANGE IS IRREVERSIBLE:**

```sh
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft lckfactory '[0]' -p ultra.nft.ft@active
```

Updating a token hash of factory `0` afterwards will fail:

```sh
cleos push action eosio.nft.ft settknmeta '[
  0,
  "ultra",
  "update hash 2",
  "ipfs://",
  "cccf7bb05104ee6737d94a7f85b3cf4a9f44f67f2d198572c155721a07395613"
]' -p ultra.nft.ft@active
Error 10500149: token hash must be same value
Error Details:
assertion failure with message: token hash must be same value
```

# Validating Metadata

The factory metadata contains information about each file, including its integrity. This integrity is established by calculating a hash using the SHA256 algorithm, which is typically represented in hex format. Additionally, the type of hash used is usually SHA256 for uniqs created on Ultra.

However, it is important to discuss the specific methods employed to generate these SHA256 values in the first place.

## Why SHA256?

SHA256 become a popular and widely adopted cryptographic hash function. 

Its speed and efficiency are quite good when generating hash values.

SHA256 is easily implementable in all programming languages with minimal effort.

## Integrity Building Process

1. Walk through each object in the metadata and determine if it is a `StaticResource`.

```ts
export interface StaticResource {
    contentType: MimeTypes | null;
    uris: string[];
    integrity: {
        type: 'SHA256';
        hash: string;
    } | null;
}
```

2. If the `integrity` in a `StaticResource` is set to `null` then we need to generate it.
3. We loop through each of the `uris` and generate a `hash` for each `uri` and append it to a single `string`.

```ts
let contentHashes = '';
for (let i = 0; i < someData.uris.length; i++) {
    const newHash = someHashBuilder(someData.uris[i]); // Usually checks if local or external
    contentHashes += newHash;
}
```

4. We generate a `SHA256` of the `contentHashes`.
5. We append that `SHA256` hash and generate the `integrity` for that `StaticResource` in the file.
6. Repeat until all `StaticResource` objects have integrity generated.
7. Hash the contents of the metadata file (`json`) and that will be the `hash` that you pass to the chain.

## Create HASH from File

In most cases we use the standard `crypto` [library the comes with NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#class-hash).

However there is a fairly simple process for generating the `hash` data.

### TS/JS Example

```ts
const stream = fs.createReadStream(someFilePath);
const hash = createHash('sha256', { encoding: 'hex' });
stream.pipe(hash);

await new Promise((resolve: Function) => {
    stream.on('end', () => {
        resolve();
    });
});

return hash.read();
```

## Create HASH from External Content

In some cases we have `external` content that needs to be hashed as well. This means that the file is already uploaded on an external server somewhere and we need to fetch the content and create a `hash` from that data.

We **do not format** anything that comes back from a URL; we ensure that the response is okay and assume the content is correct.

### TS/JS Example

```ts
const response = await fetch(url);
if (!response.ok) {
    return undefined;
}

const hash = createHash('sha256', { encoding: 'hex' });
response.body.pipe(hash);

await new Promise((resolve: Function) => {
    response.body.on('end', () => {
        resolve();
    });
});

return hash.read();
```

## Single File Verification

To verify a single `.json` file along with its data, it is advisable to use the hash that is available on-chain and compare it with the contents of the file. By hashing the contents of the `.json` file and verifying it against the chain, you can ensure the validity of the entire file and its contents. 

However, if you require more extensive verification, you will need to inspect each `uri` and validate the contents of all `uris` that are present in `uris` property, and then follow the aforementioned steps to ensure the validity of the data.
