# How to get tokens on Testnet

Issuing tokens to your account on Ultra's Testnet blockchain is done using the Ultra faucet tool [Ultra Testnet Tools](https://faucet.testnet.app.ultra.io/). In the Ultra Wallet, when you are using a Testnet account, the "Buy UOS" button also redirects to this tool.

When you open the Faucet, you have to copy/paste your blockchain account, pass the captcha quiz, and click the button “Issue”. There is a rate limit of 10 UOS every two minutes.
