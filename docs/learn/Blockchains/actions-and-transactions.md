# Actions & Transactions

Actions and Transactions are the meat and potatoes of the network, with the former being functions called from deployed smart contracts, and the latter being single or combined actions sent to a Block Producer for consideration by the chain.

Transactions sent to a typical EOSIO-based network happen on a first come, first served basis. We’ll talk about an exception to this within the context of Ultra’s network in a bit.
