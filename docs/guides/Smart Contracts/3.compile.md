# Smart Contract Compiling

Compiling smart contracts is very simple with the [Ultra.io Smart Contract Toolkit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ultraio.ultra-cpp).

If docker is installed correctly it will automatically download our development image, and use the image to compile your contracts.

## How to Compile

There are **two ways** to compile your smart contract.

1. Make sure you have the `.cpp` file open and selected and click `Compile` at the bottom of VSCode.

2. Use the `Command Palette (F1)` under `Ultra: Build Contract`

## Successful Compilation

If successful you won't see any `errors` in the output window for `ultra-cpp`.

## Bad Compilation

If unsuccessful you will see various errors such as the ones below.

## Compiled Files

Once the files are compiled you should see an `abi` and a `wasm` file next to your compiled smart contract.
