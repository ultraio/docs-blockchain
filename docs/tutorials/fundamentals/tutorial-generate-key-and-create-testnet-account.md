# Tutorial - Generate a key and create a developer Testnet account

This tutorial will cover the simplest process of creating a developer account on Testnet to be used to interact with the blockchain.

## Prerequisites

-   No prerequisites

## Goal

The goal of this tutorial is to generate a unique key pair that will be used to create a new developer Testnet blockchain account. The account will later be used in later tutorials to demonstrate interaction with the blockchain.

## Generate a Key Pair

First we will generate a [private and public key](../../blockchain/general/antelope-ultra/public-and-private-keys.md). To do so use the form below and press the `Generate Key` button.

<KeyGenerator />

## Keep the keys safe

You will need both public and private key you've just generated in later tutorials. The public key (the one that starts with `EOS`) can be shared publicly with anyone. But the private key (begins with `5`) should be kept secret and not shared with anyone.

::: info

The simplest approach for now to keep your private key for later use would be to write it down on a piece of paper. It is not a good practice to store your private key openly in a text file on your machine.
