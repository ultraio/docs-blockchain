This account employs keypairs linked to permissions, controlling access to specific network actions.</p><p>A keypair, generated through elliptic curve cryptography, involves associating private and public keys. The private key proves ownership of an account, which, in turn, has a public key assigned to one of its permissions.</p><p>Ultra accounts come with default permissions called OWNER and ACTIVE. OWNER functions as a superuser, capable of updating keys for all permissions as the root permission. ACTIVE, another default permission, can execute all actions on the account except updating keys to the OWNER permission.</p><p>Smart contracts are deployed to an account, and each action within a smart contract can have keys assigned to it. This feature allows for specific limitations on which entity, along with which keypair, can call that action.</p><h2 id="account-structure-output" tabindex="-1">Account Structure Output <a class="header-anchor" href="#account-structure-output" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Account Structure Output&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span>permissions:</span></span>
